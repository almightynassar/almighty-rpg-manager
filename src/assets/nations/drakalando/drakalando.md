# Fractious Factions

There are many factions in the Supremancy, but they can be broken down into two main ideological themes (with a few esoteric outliers).

## Proprieto (Property)

They believe in the supreme dominance of the Dragon species over all other life, such that all other life can be considered the property of Dragons. This may include, but is not limited to:

- Complete and utter destruction of the Shadowrealm and the Gauld
- Subjugation or Extermination of all other mortals
- Enslavement of sentient creatures
- Extract tribute from other nation-states

## Administro (Administration)

They believe that the Dragons are the stewards of all other life, and that Dragons have a duty to guide and regulate mortal matters. They believe that the Gauld overreached and had to be stopped before they ruined the balance of the realms.

- Keep Gauld banished in the Shadowrealm as punishment for their overreach
- Work with mortals for mutual benefit

# Enemies of the Gauld

The Dragons are eternal enemies of the Gauld, and will endeavour to stop the Gauld from returning the Midrealm.
