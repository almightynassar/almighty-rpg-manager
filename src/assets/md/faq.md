# FAQ

## What's the Sundering?

The Sundering was the monumental event where the Gauld fashioned the Shadowrealm and permenantly left Mid-Realm. Common mythology tells that the Gauld did this because they were too proud to accept defeat at the hands of the [gods](#/cosmology/deities) and their monsters, and so sulked and took their toys with them. Other myths state that the gods played dirty and created a genocidal virus that would have wiped out the Gauld, and so the Gauld escaped to the Shadowrealm to ensure their survival. The exact truth is hard to determine since the Gauld in the Shadowrealm are notoriously obtuse, the dragons are too arrogant and proud, and the gods simply don't talk to mortals.

The fact is that the Sundering left only Gauldish technology, monsters and the Forged behind. The new sentient races entered a Terrea that was already developed, and used this to jumpstart their civilisiation in less than 500 years.

## What's the deal with religion on Terrea?

There is only one dominate religion on Terrea, but there are many branches of doctrine (and levels of belief). The only common theme is that if the [gods](#/cosmology/deities) of Terrea exist then they do not interfere with mortal affairs, or at least do not provide tangible and objective evidence of their existence. Believers surmise that the gods have resolved to butt out of mortal affairs after the Sundering, while non-believers claim that the absence of evidence is proof enough.

In short, mortals simply try to appease the gods to avoid their ire and occassionally petition their favour for a good harvest or some other boon. There are also some cults and "prophets" that claim that they have met the divine, but their influence is generally localised to a specific area.

## What about magic?

All [magic](#/cosmology/magic) on Terrea is sourced from the [Aether](#/cosmology/realms) itself. This magical energy can be harnessed and used, and so it also a critical part of technology. Most scholars classify magic into four forms:

 - **Primordial**: An individual uses their physical presence in Mid-Realm as a conduit to harness the raw energy directly from the Aether. This is a rare form that hasn't been seen since the Gauld, as most mortals expire when exposed to raw Aether energy. Also known as **Elemental** magic.
 - **Technological**: Includes all forms of artificial and mechanical means of harnessing Aether energy. A common way that this is accomplished is by refining pure Aether energy into Shards, which is then used as 'batteries' to power devices that produce magical or technological effects.
 - **Spectral**: A form that traces it's history back to the Gauld, it requires that an individual manifests an 'avatar' in the Aether realm through sheer willpower. This spectral avatar is then used as a conduit, allowing the individual to manifest magical effects in Mid-Realm. The secrets of Spectral power is jealously guarded by it's practitioners.
 - **Natural**: The most common form of magic, but the least potent. All life on Terrea is distantly linked to the Aether, and some individuals have been able to leverage this link to gain limited abilities. These abilities generally relate to the individual's experience, such as a soldier gaining super reflexes or a thief gaining increased agaility.

Sorcerers, Warlocks, and Wizards do not exist in the world of Terrea, and are not available as playable classes. Mystics from Unearther Arcana is used to mimic Spectral abilities. Artificers use Shards to power their magic-like technology. All other "magical" class abilities can be considered as Natural magic.

## Where can we go to buy equipment?

Most mundane piecies of equipment are available at settlements as long as an appropriate trade building is available (for example, weapons and armour require a blacksmith). The [Gear list](#/gear) section will give you an idea of an average price for an item, but it may change depending on local factors.

For magical or technological equipment, you will only find (or sell) them in the larger settlements such as cities. You may be able to find buyers that are rich enough outside of these locations, but there is no guarantee that they will be interested in the piece that you have to offer.

## Where can we go to get armour custom fitted for this monster or beast I just befriended?

You can't use any old blacksmith for highly custom pieces. You will need to seek out a master of the craft, which can usually be found in the larger settlements. The [Federation of Guilds](#/nations/federation) in the land of Bounty are especially known for their high quality and masterwork gear.

## Where can we go for healing?

Most settlements will have a healer (or someone who does healing part-time), but for more serious injuries you will either need to send for an experienced doctor or transport the patient to them. Most local healers should be able to deal with most common versions of poisons and dieseases. Take a look at the [healing services](#/healing) for a rough guide on what is available.

## Is resurrection possible?

Yes, although it will draw the attention and ire of [Baltha](#/cosmology/deities). The God does not appreciate when a soul is taken from their domain. Because of this, people with the knowledge of how to resurrect the dead either need a very good reason or be very well compensated.

## Is there a cure for undeath (zombies, ghouls and vampires)?

Yes, but again it will involve taking a soul back from the nether and therefore draw Baltha's attention. This is because when an undead is created, the original soul is seperated from the corpse and sent to the Nether. The corpse left behind is then reanimated with a twisted 'clone' of the original soul, retaining some memories and personality traits of the original. It is not known if the new soul is generated from Nether or Aether energies.

Baltha does not particularly care for the undead themselves, and they can be destroyed without drawing the attention of the God.

## Are there any places where swords are illegal, magic is outlawed, or other notable hassles from the law?

Most large settlements frown on or restrict the open-carry of weapons while inside the settlement. But the only major thing is to not go into debt with a dwarf; the [Federation of Guilds](#/nations/federation) have legalised slavery as an acceptable form of debt-recovery.

## What monsters are terrorizing the countryside sufficiently that if I kill them I will become famous?

There are monsters everywhere on Terrea, but of particular note are: Aboleths, Dragons, Krakens, Remorhazes', Vampires

## Are there any wars we can fight in?

The [Partisans](#/nations/partisans) are freedom fighters trying to liberate the nations of the Lefantia, Teztec, and Azia from the expansionist [Hentergrey Empire](#/nations/hentergrey). The Orcs are currently raiding both the Merfolk of [Myrmiddon](#/nations/myrmiddon) and the [Snvert](#/nations/snvert), but it is not a war of conquest.

## How about gladitorial arenas to compete in and with glory and fabulous prizes?

The Orc Tribes and Goblin city-states love their combat games (especially those that go to the death), while the Hentergrey Empire indulges in formalised tournaments. The other nations may sometimes dabble in combat-based entertainment, but it is not a regular part of their culture.

## Where can I hire mercenaries? Or find sages and other knowledge specialists?

Mercenaries can be found almost anywhere, since wandering monsters are a constant threat. Orcish pirates also terrorize the seas. As for knowledge experts, it will depend on the rarity of the knowledge. But it should be safe to assume that nation capitals are sufficiently large enough to support these types of experts.

## Is there any magic guilds or orders that we can join to get more spells/artifacts?

The Academy is the most pervasive institution in Terrea, as it is decentralised and focuses on sharing knowledge. Members of the academy constantly submit papers on magic theory (whether it is spectral-, primordial-, or nature-based) and try to increase the shared knowledge pool.

For spectral-based magic there are some scattered schools that teach a specific form of harnessing spectral powers, but they guard their secrets zealously. To gain their knowledge, you will need to earn their trust and keep secret any knowledge gained. These schools are generally reclusive and avoided by the general populace because of the rumours surrounding the initiation to become a spectre-user.

The S.N.V.E.R.T (Snvert New Viable Elemental Retrieval Team) are an expedition force that seeks out primordial shards and new Gauld technology to bring back for the benefit of all Snvert. They wish to avoid the economic disaster facing the Snvert peoples, and also rid their lands of the Orc menance.

## Are there any secret societies that I could join or fight?

Secret societies are secret for a reason, but there are some rumours and conspiracies that continue to stay alive. These include:

 - The Collectors are specters that are hoarding any and all secrets related to specter powers, as they deem that mortals are not worthy of the power. They are rumoured to be based around the ruins of Trellisanthe, and are supposedly behind the tragic "accidents" that befall any expedition to the ruins.
 - The nation of Illumi Naati are rumoured to have special agents placed throughout all levels of government in Terrea. These agents use a silver-tongue to beguile those in power, and are backed by heavy hitting special force. No one knows what their agenda is, but rumours are that they are working with the Collectors.
 - There are ongoing rumours that the rulers of the Hentergrey Empire, the Perlio dynasty, have gone mad and have a dark pact with Primus, ruler of the Shadowrealm. The expansion of the Empire is seen as a way to cover mass sacrifices that give Primus the power they need to leave the Shadowrealm and defeat the Gods once and for all.
 - The Dragons of the Citadel covet rulership over all of Terrea, but are too focused on internal power struggles. But there is a constant fear that some dragons are making shadowy moves to consolidate power among mortals, and eventually take control.

## What food is there to eat?

Most modern food exist in Terrea, and are traded widely. It shouldn't be hard to find your favourite dish, although substitute ingredients may be used. Regional dishes can be informed by checking out what [animals](#/ecology/animals) and [plants](#/ecology/plants) are avialable to the region.

## Who is the most powerful person? The greatest warrior? The richest person?

The Hentergrey Emperor is the most politically powerful person in Terrea, commanding the largest continent, the largest armies, and the largest cities.

The richest person is an ongoing competition between the Merfolk and the Dwarves. Currently the fortunes of the Merfolk are waning as the Orcs raid their trade fleets, but this has also disrupted the trade routes of the Dwarves.

The greatest warriors are to be found among the Hentergrey Empire's troops, although the Partisans have many warriors that have gain reknown by standing against the Empire. The Orcs can also lay claim to the title, as their constant raiding provides fertile ground for warrior training.

The most powerful specter user is unknown, since many of the schools are secretive and avoid displaying their prowess so that their enemies cannot learn their secrets.
