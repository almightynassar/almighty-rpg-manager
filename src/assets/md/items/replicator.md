# Replicator

**Rarity:** Very Rare
**Weight:** 15 kg

An replicator is an ancient Gauldian ornate metal chest that weighs 15 kilograms while empty. Its interior compartment is a cube measuring 0.5m on a side.

The replicator has 20 charges. A creature can use an action to touch a button on the closed lid of the replicator and expend 1 of the replicator's charges while naming one or more nonmagical objects (including raw materials, foodstuffs, and liquids) worth a total of 100 cp or less. The named objects magically appear in the replicator, provided they can all fit inside it and the replicator doesn't contain anything else. For example, the replicator can conjure a plate of strawberries, a bowl of hot soup, a flagon of water, a stuffed animal, or a bag of twenty caltrops. Food and drink conjured by the replicator are delicious, and they spoil if not consumed after 24 hours. Gems and precious metals created by the replicator disappear after 1 minute.

The replicator regains 1d20 expended charges daily at dawn. If the item's last charge is expended, roll a d20. On a 1, the replicator loses its magic (becoming an ordinary chest), and its electronics turn to dust.
