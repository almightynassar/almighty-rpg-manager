# Active Camo Gear

**Rarity:** Uncommon
**Weight:** 5kg

*Requires attunement*

Made out of intelligent material that can change it's coloration to better blend into the background. While you are wearing all of the gear and activating it, Wisdom (Perception) checks made to see you have disadvantage, and you have advantage on Dexterity (Stealth) checks made to hide, as the colours shift to camoflage you. Activating the gear requires an action.
