# Rocket Launcher

**Rarity:** Rare
**Weight:** 15kg

*Requires attunement*

A powerful Gauldian weapon of war. This weapon has 7 charges (also known as rounds). While holding it, you can use an action to expend 1 or more of its charges to fire a rocket. You can spend additional charges to make the rocket more powerful.

The launcher regains 1d6 + 1 expended charges daily at dawn. If you expend the launcher's last charge, roll a d20. On a 1, the launcher crumbles into ashes and is destroyed.

The launcher has a range of 45m/150 ft (30 squares), and the rocket lands at a point you choose within range. Each creature in a 6m/20ft (4 square) radius must make a Dexterity saving throw (DC 15). A target takes 8d6 fire damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. The fire spreads around corners, and it will ignite flammable objects in the area that aren't being worn or carried.

Each additional charge increases the damage by 1d6, up to a maximum of 6 additional charges.
