An wondrous Gauldian device that can transform into a variety of tools; as an action, you can touch the item and transform it into any type of artisan's tool of your choice. Whatever form the tool takes, you are proficient with it.

As an action, you can focus on the tool to channel your creative forces. Choose a cantrip that you don't know from any class list (with approval from the GM).
