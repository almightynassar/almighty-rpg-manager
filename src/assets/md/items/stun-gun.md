# Stun Gun

**Rarity:** Rare
**Weight:** 5kg

An ancient Gauldian weapon that was used to pacify unruly subjects. This gun has 7 charges. While holding it, you can use an action to expend 1 or more of its charges to create a thin blue ray to streak towards a create you see up to 18m/60ft (12 squares) away. The target must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw or be **paralysed** for 1 minute. At the end of each of the target's turns, it can repeat the saving throw, ending the effect on itself on a success.

The gun regains 1d6 + 1 expended charges daily at dawn. If you expend the gun's last charge, roll a d20. On a 1, the gun crumbles into ashes and is destroyed.
