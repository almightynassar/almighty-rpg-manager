# Gauld Rifle

**Rarity:** Uncommon
**Weight:** 5kg

An ancient Gauldian weapon of war. This rifle has 7 charges (or bullets). While holding it, you can use an action to expend 1 or more of its charges to fire three bullets from it. You can increase the damage of a bullet by one for each additional charge you expend.

The rifle regains 1d6 + 1 expended charges daily at dawn. If you expend the rifle's last charge, roll a d20. On a 1, the rifle crumbles into ashes and is destroyed.

The rifle has a range of 36m/120ft (24 squares), and you select up to three targets within range. A bullet deals 1d4 + 1 piercing damage to its target. The bullets all strike virtually simultaneously. Additional charges create one extra bullet to fire.
