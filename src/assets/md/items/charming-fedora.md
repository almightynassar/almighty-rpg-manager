A Black Fedora hat that alters your brain waves of the wearer to imbue a sense of confidence and lowers inhibitions. The hat has 3 charges, and when worn you can expend 1 charge as an action to attempt to charm one person (Wisdom Save DC 13) within 9m/30 ft (6 squares) of you, provided that you and the target can see each other. The hat regains all expended charges at the next dawn.
