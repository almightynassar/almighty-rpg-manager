Terrea is a small planet, with a unique feature being that the southern poles are covered in active volcanos that are constantly erupting. There is speculation that this high-level of volcanic activity may have something to do with the intersection of the Realms. Another curiousity is that the volcanoes do not emit as much material during eruption, and instead they serve as a sort of "heater" for the southern regions. The only exception is the region of Bounty, which is so close to the volcanoes that they experience regular blackouts of the sky and is covered in ash. However, the volcanic material makes the land extremely fertile leading to a constantly boom-bust cycle.

The volcanic activity means that the air currents generally originate from the south pole, travelling in a north-west direction. This air current and high temperatures means that the Treasure Islands and Tezonian Jungle regions constantly experience high levels of rainfall, and are therefore rich in diverse life. The Tezonian mountain ranges ensure most of the rainfall falls on the jungle, but some makes it past into the Girth Marshes. Finally, the air currents travel eastwards across the Levengeti and then across the World Center and the Shattered Isles. The air current are able to pick up moisture from the rivers and coasts in the Levengeti, meaning that the eastern regions is able to experience more rainfall.

The smaller volcanic activity in the Naati Badlands dictates the air currents of the northern hemisphere, but these are overshadowed by the power of the southern currents. The Azia Desert will experience some of it's rainfall due to these northerly winds, but the southerly air currents that make it across the Azia mountains generally keeps the rainfall along the northern coasts. Instead, Tauria experiences most of this rainfall.
