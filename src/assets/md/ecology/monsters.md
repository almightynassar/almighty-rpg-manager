# Aboleths

Large fish-like amphibians with long tubular bodies, circular lamprey-like mouths filled with jawless teeth, and four tendril-like tentacles. Aboleths do not die of old age and so live on indefinitely, barring violence or old age. They also continually grow, meaning the oldest Aboleths are also the largest.

All Aboleths are hermaphroditic, possessing both male and female reproductive organs. They lay eggs, which gestate over five years before hatching into fully functional Aboleths.

They have powerful psionic powers which allow them to transform unlucky beings into mindless servants, altering the bodies of their victims into forms best able to serve the Aboleth. They also have a sort of racial memory, where the children inherit the memories of their ancestors. They can also assimilate the memories of the victims it consumes.

Aboleths were created by the Gods to combat the island nations of the ancient Gauld

# Dragons

Dragons were the ultimate weapon crafted by the Gods in their war against the ancient Gauld. They are large-to-gigantic flying reptilian mammals that can breathe out various elemental energies, and are very difficult to kill. They are also extremely cunning and intelligent. They only thing keeping Dragons from ruling the world of Terrea are Dragons themselves; Dragons are constantly fighting each other. Dragons do not die of old age and so live on indefinitely, barring violence or old age. They also continually grow, meaning the oldest Dragons are also the largest.

There are many different types of Dragons, each with unique abilities. Wyverns are also classed as a type of Dragon, but are generally weaker and simply serve their larger cousins.

# Krakens

A gigantic squid-like creature that dominates the oceans of Terrea. 

# Remorhazes

A gigantic monstrosity that is a cross between a worm and a centipede. They survive in the coldest regions, having an inner fire that could melt all but the strongest metal.

# Vampires

Vampires were created by the Gods to assassinate powerful Gauldan Specters. They are able to blend into society easily, and use the Nether-sourced powers to drain the lifeforce and willpower of their targets. Vampires are considered to be undead monsters.
