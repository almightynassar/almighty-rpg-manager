# Aboleths

Large fish-like amphibians with long tubular bodies, circular lamprey-like mouths filled with jawless teeth, and four tendril-like tentacles. Aboleths do not die of old age and so live on indefinitely, barring violence or old age. They also continually grow, meaning the oldest Aboleths are also the largest.

All Aboleths are hermaphroditic, possessing both male and female reproductive organs. They lay eggs, which gestate over five years before hatching into fully functional Aboleths.

They have powerful psionic powers which allow them to transform unlucky beings into mindless servants, altering the bodies of their victims into forms best able to serve the Aboleth. They also have a sort of racial memory, where the children inherit the memories of their ancestors. They can also assimilate the memories of the victims it consumes.

Aboleths were created by the Gods to combat the island nations of the ancient Gauld

# Dragons

Dragons were the main monstrous antagonists in the war against the ancient Gauld. They are large-to-gigantic flying reptilian mammals that can breathe out various elemental energies, and are very difficult to kill. They are also extremely cunning and intelligent. They only thing keeping Dragons from ruling the world of Terrea are Dragons themselves; Dragons are constantly fighting each other. Dragons do not die of old age and so live on indefinitely, barring violence or old age. They also continually grow, meaning the oldest Dragons are also the largest.

- **Effectively Immortal:** Dragons do not die of old age but can succumb to disease, wounds, poor health, and other causes.
- **Egotistical:** Dragons believe that they are the natural rulers of Terrea, and are superior than all mortals (including the Gauld)
- **Greedy:** Natural hoarders of power, wealth, and influence. They loathe to share with others.
- **Curious:** They have an innate wanderlust and a thirst for knowledge.
- **Long Memories:** A dragon has a generational memory, and will generally remember the character of groups of mortals rather than individuals. They also never forget slights or threats.
- **Elemental Breath:** Dragons have a natural breath weapon that deals elemental damage. The breath weapon that a dragon uses is partly inherited, partly environmental. The colour of a dragon does not factor into the breath type.
- **Gerontocracy:** Ruled by the eldest dragons in the local tribe or faction. There is no centralised authority when it comes to Dragons, as they are always fighting with each other.

## Wyverns
Wyverns are simply the runts of a Dragonâ€™s litter. A female Dragon can birth one full sized dragon and roughly a dozen Wyverns. A female Wyvern can birth two or three.
Wyverns are less intelligent and more bestial than their larger brethren, and can still understand  and speak some Draconic. They are generally loyal to a fault to their familial clan, and are used as soldiers and workers.

# Krakens

A gigantic squid-like creature that dominates the oceans of Terrea. 

# Remorhazes

A gigantic monstrosity that is a cross between a worm and a centipede. They survive in the coldest regions, having an inner fire that could melt all but the strongest metal.

# Vampires

Vampires were created by the Gods to assassinate powerful Gauldan Specters, as their powers mirror and counter the average Specter. They are able to blend into society easily, and use the Nether-sourced powers to drain the lifeforce and willpower of their targets. Vampires are considered to be undead monsters.

The party encountered and defeated two Vampires in the secret underground facility of Mandevrath (**Kruxas** and **Moixa**). However the head vampire, **Drafus Malfium**, is still at large.
