# Animals

The animals of Terrea would seem to be hybrids of the animals found on Earth. However, there are some earth creatures that can be found natively in Terrea:

 - Birds
 - Domesticated animals (Cattle, Chickens, Pigs, Sheep)
 - Fish
 - Horses (Levengeti and World Center)
 - Insects
 - Rodents (Rabbits, Rats, Mice, Squirrels)
 - Snakes & Lizards
 - Spiders

 *NB: The crystal caves of Crystalis are home to mostly fungus, insects, and small rodents*
