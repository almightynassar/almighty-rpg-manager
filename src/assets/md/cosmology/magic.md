# Magic

## Primordial / Elemental

Primodial (or Elemental) magic is powered through the use of **Shards**. Shards are crystalline minerals that contain pure Aether energy, and can be found in abundant supply on Terrea. Shards were used by the ancient Gauld as an energy source for their technology to manipulate reality in different ways. In other words, Shards are the "batteries" that power Primordial techonology to create magical effects.

Because Shards were created by the Primordials, the allies to the ancient Gauld in their war against the Gods, Primordial magic is often associated with the Shadowrealm.

Modern Artificiers use the Shards they find to power technological marvels, which drives the economy in some nations.

## Spectral

The most common form of magic that is found on Terrea. An individual can draw upon the Aether directly using sheer willpower to create Spectral effects, however this process is very taxing on the mind and body. Spectral abilities are generally limited in scope, and is related in some form to the individual's personality, physicality, or emotional state.

The only beings able to fully unlock the power of Spectral magic are the Specters. Specters are able to manifest an avatar in the Aether realm, and this manifestation allows the Specter to draw upon the Aether directly without suffering ill-effects. However, most Specters are created during a near-death or other traumatic experience. Some scholars postulate that this extreme experience forces the Specter to concentrate their willpower in such a way as to call their avatar into existence. 

Other individuals can have limited access to Spectral abilities, such as the abilities of Barbarians, Monks, and Clerics. Their willpower is strong enough to draw upon the Aether directly without suffering ill-effects.

## Natural

Natural magic relies on the fact that all lifeforce is created by the Aether. Whereas Primordial magic uses Shards as their "batteries", Natural magic instead uses organisms as the source of their abilities. There is a risk that using organisms in this manner will drain the life out of them, and killing an organism in this manner is highly frowned upon by practitioners.

This source of power is mainly used by the Druids.
