# Magic

## Primordial

Terrea has an abundant supply of Shards, which are crystalline minerals that contain pure Aether energy. Shards were used by the ancient Gauld as an energy source for their technology to manipulate reality in different ways.

## Spectral

The most common form of magic. An individual can draw upon the Aether directly using sheer willpower, however this process is very taxing. Most individuals cannot tap into the aether, and those who do usually have limited access (such as the abilities of Barbarians, Monks, and Clerics). The only beings able to fully unlock the power of Spectral magic are the Specters. Specters are able to manifest their willpower in the Aether, and this manifestation allows the Specter to draw upon the Aether directly without suffering ill-effects. Most Specters are created during a near-death experience.

## Natural

Because all lifeforce on Terrea originated from the Aether, some scholars are able to manipulate that energy directly. This source of power is mainly used by the Druids.
