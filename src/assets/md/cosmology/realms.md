# Realms

The Realms of Terrea are the Aether, Nether, Mid Realm, and Shadow Realm. They are overlapping realities that interact with each other, and some mortals claim to be able to shift between them. Denizens of the other realms can see into the overlapped Mid Realm, although the Mid Realm will appear to be muted and blurry to them.

Normally, creatures can't attack other creatures located in a different realm. Creatures in any of the realms will appear to be invisible and utterly silent to someone in the overlapped Mid Realm, and solid objects in the overlapped Mid Realm do not hamper the movement of creatures in the other realms. There are exceptions for some magical effects and beings such as Specters.

The World Center in the Mid Realm is a special place where the boundaries between the realms are especially thin. This allows denizens from any of the realms to shift across to a different realm with ease.

## Aether

The Aether is the realm of creation, beginnings, imagination, willpower, and possibilities. It is where all creatures, monsters, and objects were created before entering into the Mid Realm. It is powered equally by the pleasant dreams of the content as it is by the nightmares of the tormented.

It is also the realm of the Specters, the astral manifestation of willpower. Specters are tied to the mortal who created it, and can directly interact with the Mid Realm to produce powerful magical effects. When the mortal dies, so does their Specter.

## Mid-Realm

The Mid Realm is the experienced reality of mortals. It is where all existence is played out, after they are gifted with a life by the Aether until that life is claimed by the Nether. This is where all adventures will be played out.

## Nether

The Nether is the realm of entropy, death, finality, apathy, and certainty. It is where all things go when they die, the final chapter of their story. No matter what type of life you lived, whether you were a force for good or evil, it is certain that you will end up in the Nether.

Resurrection is possible in Terrea, although difficult, because all things exist forever in the Nether. The soul must be willing and able to return, and must be able to inhabit a functional body. However, a resurrection may incur the wrath of Baltha, God of the Nether.

## Shadow Realm

The Shadow Realm is where the ancient Gauldian and Primordial races retreated to after their struggle with the Gods, led by the powerful immortal Primus. As they left their mortal bodies behind they became the Spirits and Daemons that inhabit the Shadow Realm. It is a realm that is a mere shadow of the others, and it evokes a feeling of dread, pity, and vengence.

The Shadow Realm was split from the Mid Realm in an event called the Sundering, and it was formed out of the primordial essence that powered the magical technology of the Gauld. Because primoridal essence is a key ingredient of magic in Terrea, those who use it are thought to have ties with the Shadow Realm.
