# Deities

The deities of Terrea are the divine embodiments of the realms. They are beyond the issues of morality that plagues mortals, and cannot be described as either good or evil. They are driven to do both wonderful and terrible things, and are the driving force behind many of the important moments and myths of Terrea.

They are also capracious and fickle beings, each seeking to become the main divine force in Terrea and rule over the other gods. The unspoken rule of this competition is to never do anything that would threaten the existence of the realms or the Gods.

While technically not a deity in the classic sense, Primus is sometimes considered worthy of worship by mortals. Followers are usually drawn to the ideals of freedom, independence, and self-realistion. Opponents to Primus argue that the immortal represents self-indulgent pride and hubris

## Artra

The God of Aether and Creation, and the most chaotic and unpredicatable of the Gods. They delight in ideas and forms, and are always trying to come up with something 'new'. Followers of Artra try to emulate their God's creativity and inquisitiveness.

Artra is the reason why there are so many mortal races in the Mid Realm, as they copulated with humans to create beastial hybrids. They were also the driving force behind the quantity and variety of monsters in Mid-Realm, as they delighted in coming up with new and interesting ways to combat the ancient Gauldian threat.

## Baltha

The God of Nether and Entropy, and the most dour and serious of the Gods. They desire that everything follows a defined and rigid plan, and will become annoyed when things do not play out as predicted. Followers of Baltha try to emulate their God's discipline and organisational skills.

Baltha is seen as the steady hand that refines all life on Terrea, ensuring that everything created has a purpose. This, of course, regularly puts the God at odds with Artra, who desires to change everything.

## Rulik

The God of the Mid Realm and Balance, and is usually the mediator between the other two Gods. However they will only intervene if the status quo is under threat, preferring to care for mortals at a distance.

When the war between the Gods and the ancient Gauld threatened to destroy all of Terrea, it was Rulik who negotiated the peace and created the Shadowrealm. Because of his role of mediator, followers of Rulik try to emulate him through rhetoric and logic.

Rulik was also instrumental in the creation of the Specters, as they were worried about the unchecked potential of the wonderous technological devices powered by primordial essence. Specters allowed mortals to use Spectral abilities that matched the power of essence, and became crucial in maintaining a balance in the Mid Realm.

## Primus

Primus is technically not a God, but the first sentient being who eventually became the ruler of the Shadow Realm. An immortal with a direct connection to the Aether, Primus constantly found themselves opposed by Baltha. The God of Entropy could not stand the idea of a being escaping the Nether, and tried to hinder Primus wherever they could. This eventually led to Primus uniting the ancient Gauld and Primordials to rise up and try to overthrow the Gods, but their ultimate failure led to Primus being banished to the Shadow Realm.

Primus is a controversial figure to the mortals of Terrea. Some see Primus as a tragic tale of wasted potential, a being gifted with limitless power that is squandered by pride and greed. To others, Primus is a freedom fighters and a symbol that the power of the Gods is not absolute.
