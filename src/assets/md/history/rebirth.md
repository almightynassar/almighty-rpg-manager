The victory celebration of the Gods was brief as the Gauldish population dwindled in the Mid-Realm, and Terrea fell silent. Their hearts ached for what they had lost, as the Gauld and Primordials were still their children. With a heavy heart the Gods watched the remaining Gauld and Forged retreat into the crumbling citadels of Phalanxis, Trellisanthe, and Al-Khaleera.

In their quest for redemption and self-forgiveness, the Gods fashioned the human race in the image of the Gauld. The humans were shorter, less intelligent and less capable than the Gauld, but they retained a sense of Gauldish inquisitiveness. The first humans emerged out of the World-Center into Mid-Realm, and journeyed out and inhabited the citadel of Hirst.

Meanwhile in Phalanxis, Sesom the Wanderer rose up to become the leader of the remaining Gauld and Forged. He sought to preserve all of the knowledge of the Gauld by increasing the memory capacity and processing speed of the Forged, thereby creating the Elderforged. Sesom ultimately wanted to bring about the return of the Gauld to Mid-Realm, by either reversing the sterility of his peoples or by un-sundering the realms. Sesom passed before he could realise his vision, but there are rumours that Sesom found the secret to immortality and continues his work deep underground and that the Elderforged are the key to his plans.

The remaining Gauld Specters sought refuge in the jungle citadel of Trellisanthe, where they created the secret order of The Collectors. The organisation quickly and covertly sought out powerful Spectre users among the emerging human race and inducted them into their ranks, ensuring that their secrets would continue to live on. They continue on to this day, securing any spectral artifacts to safeguard it.

The humans began to spread across all of Mid-Realm as the Gauld and Primordials died out, and the Gods were beginning to get bored again. They were dissatisfied with the progress made by the humans compared to their Gaulish ancestors, and they each set to work to try to “remedy” this so-called problem in their own way. Rulik sought to create races that filled a role, and gave life to the Snvert, Dwarves and Teztec. Artra created his new races in a more “personal” manner and created the Lefantians, Lacerti, Avians, Mermen, and Minotaurs. Baltha, always ruled by order and death, created the Goblins, Orcs, and Locanth.

As the age came to a close, the sentient races began to create their own unique cultural identity. The humans united under the first King, Perlio Hentergrey, centered around the ancient Gauldish capital of Hirst. The Teztec inhabited the Tezonian Jungles and mastered the primordial essence found in all natural things. The Mermen utilised their mastery of the oceans to become sea-faring traders, while competing with the industrial might of the Dwarves. The Snvert repurposed ancient Gauldian technology to power their cities, while the Orcs and Goblins plunder and raid their neighbours. The minotaurs were able to grow crops in the far north, and the Avians were able to inhabit the deserts of Azia. As the young races matured and the natural land tamed, tension began to rise...
