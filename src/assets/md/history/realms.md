Life always has a beginning, a middle, and an end. All three are necessary and complement each other. And so, the world is composed of three equal parts; the aether, the Mid-Realm, and the nether. The aether is the beginning of all things, and is known as the plane of creation and growth. The Mid-Realm is where everything exists, and where every story is told. And the nether is where all things must end, either remembered or forgotten, and is known as the plane of entropy and decay.

Each of these realms overlap each other, as they are different aspects of the same entity. No realm could exist on itâ€™s own, and the realms became mirrors of each other. Where a mountain is formed in one realm, it will then appear in the others.

Each of the planes began to express wills and desires of their own, and these wills became the Gods of the planes. Artra ruled over the aether, Rulik held dominion over the Mid-Realm, and Baltha watched over the nether. The Gods initially agreed to keep everything in balance and that all life must have a beginning, a midwsdle, and an end. But, as with all creatures that have wills and desires, they began to scheme and plot and lust after power.

As life was beginning to arrive in Mid-Realm, starting at the World-Center, Artra stealthily created Primus on an island hidden to the south, which is now known as The Blight. Primus had direct access to all of the creative energies of the aether, and could not die. This greatly angered Baltha, and the god then began to try and suck Primus out of Mid-Realm and into the nether. But Primus resisted, and drew upon the aether directly to keep them bound to Mid-Realm. The battle between Baltha and Primus cast a sickness on the island, and all lifeforms became blighted and diseased. All except the region around Primus, kept healthy by residual energy from the aether.

The battle lasted for centuries, but eventually Baltha relented. But in their fury, the lord of the nether struck a hole in the World-Center, thinning the fabric between the Mid-Realm and the other realms. If Artra was to have Primus, then Baltha would leave his mark on the World-Center. Baltha then raised up two mountains to symbolise the duality of life and death, and as a passive-aggressive reminder to the other Gods that with every beginning there must come an end.
