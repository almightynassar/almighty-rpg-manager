## The Gauldan Age

Rulik, not to be outdone by the other Gods, decides to create a people that embody Mid-Realm and it’s transient nature. Rulik fashioned the Gauld, and they emerged out of the thinning of the barrier between realms at the World-Center. They are a mortal race and, unlike Primus, they could reproduce and multiply. They are humanoid in appearance, but slightly larger than humans. Rulik gifted them with knowledge, and imbued them with the knowledge to craft tools and a desire to forge their own stories by changing the world around them to suit their needs. Baltha was appeased that the Gauld would end up in the nether when their story was done, and did not object. But Artra was offended that the Gauld could create without the aether, and secretly despised Rulik’s creation.

Primus, now free from battle with Baltha, could feel the creation of the Gauld through the aether. He left The Blight and journeyed towards the World-Center so that he could meet the Gauld. It was a positive encounter for both parties, as Primus taught the Gauld the secrets of agriculture and the Gauld showed Primus how to create without using aether. Upon the meeting spot, the Gauld fashioned the first great city of Hirst where the Gauld and Primus lived in harmony.

From the city of Hirst, the Gauld made great leaps in science and knowledge. They furthered their knowledge in maths, science, construction and agriculture. All of these advancements allowed the Gauld to spread across the different lands. They were even able to harness the power of Primordial Shards that was harvested byPrimus on their behalf from the aether, and could imbue their tools with special properties.

During this golden age, the Gauld were able to fashion an artificial sentient being called the Forged. They fashion bodies made of metal and stone, and crafted Primordial Shards in such a specific way that the metal bodies were able to come to life. The Forged have memories of their own, and are able to reason and create just like their builders.
