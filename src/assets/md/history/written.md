The Written Age was coined by the burgeoning Academy, a decentralized collective of academics and sages that actively pursued and categorised knowledge. They began to write the histories of Terrea, and began formal study of ancient Gauldish technology to see if they could recreate it. Official branches of the Academy can be found in almost all cities of Terrea, but their main headquarters can be found in Hirst.

The city of Hirst also experienced a massive political change, as King Perlio was nearing the end of his life and he had no heir. His lifespan was already unnaturally long, and there were many rumours that the King had help from supernatural forces. The Kingdom of Hentergrey became increasingly militarized and expansionist, and the King sent out his forces in search of artifacts that were connected to the Shadowrealm. People braced themselves for something dark and foreboding, not knowing what exactly was coming next.

Then, one day the King declared that he had an heir all along and that the heir would be revealed on his deathbed. And so, in a locked room with no witnesses, the King passed away that was marked by the white smoke that escaped from the chimney in his room. When the doors opened, a regal youth emerged that claimed he was the heir and that he had cremated his dying father. And so has the crown passed on along the Hentergrey dynasty; the heir hidden from his realm, only to emerge after the king has died. This has never stopped the rumours that the Hentergrey dynasty have deep ties with the Shadowrealm, a rumour that the ruling class has taken great pains to silence.

To the far north, on the continent of Naati, the Lacertan and Human colonists were finally able to realise their eugenic goal; the perfect genetic combination. The resulting offspring were called the Lacerta Hominum (or, more commonly, Lacinum). From this, their entire culture revolved around this genetic ideal, and each individual was separated into different castes. The highest social caste was reserved for the Lacinum that best represented the 50-50 genetic split between humans and lacerti, while the lowest caste were for stock standard examples of the respective species. Individuals with more Lacertan blood were generally kept as defenders of the nation, while those individuals that were more human were generally sent out abroad as operatives. It was on this basis that the nation of Illumi Naati was founded, ruled over by their Lacinum overlords.

The College of Speechcraft was also founded as a place for talented individuals in Illumi Naati to learn the art of rhetoric and persuasion. The College became a cabal of silver-tongued diplomats that have slowly inserted themselves into various positions of authority across the world. The College in particular highly values the Avians for their mimicry ability, using them as recording devices. Because of their political power, the College protect their diplomats using a highly trained force skilled in both martial and magic warfare to act as elite bodyguards and protect the interests of Illumi Naati.

One of the most notable achievements of the College was the banding of the disparate Dwarven clans into one united Federation. This Federation formalised the debt trade, which is the preferred term the Dwarves use for slavery, and allowed the Dwarves to sell their manufactured wares abroad. This achievement brought them into a pact with the Collectors, where the College would sell information about spectral artifacts while offering their powerful spectral users as bodyguards.

A massive explosion in Phalanxis released a load of primordial essence into the world, and caused damage to the ancient city. The neighbouring nation of Lefantia aided the Forged refugees, and many flocked to the ruins to try to repair (or loot) the city. These peoples are collectively known as Gearshifters, and they became the source of rumours that the explosion was caused by one of the ancient experiments left behind by Sesom that was aiming to open a direct portal to the Shadowrealm. Another interested faction, the Collectors, quickly swooped in and tried to save as many spectral artifacts they could, one of them being a unique Elderforged that had a spectre. The Elderforged was named Spectrum, and became a being of reverence among the Collectors.

In the ice-covered continent of Snvert, the Snvert delve deep into the ruins of Berelynn and cart any Gauldish technology they can find to the city of Snvert. Their whole city and economy is powered by converted technology, to the point that the Snvert Council foresaw that running out of new technology would devastate the Snvert. The council decided to create the Snvert New Viable Essence Retrieval Team (or S.N.V.E.R.T.), an expeditionary task force that is charged with travelling Terrea and bringing back new technologies to keep the economy running.

Unfortunately for the Snvert, disaster struck early. A large force of Orcs and Goblins began to raid their shores, and devastated the many villages and towns that dotted the coast. The Snvert tried to repel the raiders in a battle known as Snvertfall, but the brute strength and cunning of the green and grey skins proved too much for Snvert technology. The Snvert retreated into their towns and cities, and villages moved underground or into defensible caverns. The raids and the dwindling reserves of essence have meant that the Snvert have become increasingly desperate.

The Orcs and Goblins also sent a raiding force against the Mermen of Myrmiddon, and were able to disrupt the trading lanes. The Mermen were able to keep the Orcs from landing their raiding forces, but the Orcish fleets were still able to terrorise and pirate the merchant fleets. They also engage in pirate activity on the eastern shores of Hentergrey, but stay far away from the Citadel where the Dragons hold sway.

The Mermen, being the premier traders of Terrea, introduced a form of currency that is used by all the nations. They create trade deals with all of the nations, and compete with the Dwarves in selling high-quality wares. In particular, the Mermen were able to secure exclusive access to Minotaur pharmaceutical products.

At the close of the age, King Perlio (as every king of Hentergrey adopts the name of their ancestor upon ascension to the throne) began to have grander designs. They raised a large military force that invaded the neighbouring countries of Teztec, Lefantia, and Azia. These invasions formed the Hentergrey Empire, and the emperor began to impose a sort of martial law across Hentergrey. The military forced the citizens to use essence in their everyday lives, and the Academy was driven to research ways to access the Shadowrealm. The Emperor had an obsession with Primus, and the citizens began to informally refer to the monarch as the Dark Emperor.

That closes the Written Age, and you are at the beginning of a new age. Go forth, and write history!
