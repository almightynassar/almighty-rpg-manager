# The Party
- **Bendris Snvertson**, a Snvert Artificier looking for useful tech to take home
- **Geliah Sivvith**, a Lacinum Specter that is running from his past
- **Raorik**, an Elderforged Monk that is seeking clues to their past

- **Sigmane Clanless**, an Orc fighter that was exiled from their clan
- **Bamo**, a Kobold that is seeking a new life outside of their small world

## Droids
Droids have limited AI, and are not sentient like the Forged. They were used by the Gauld for menial labour, and many continue to serve a similar purpose today. The techniques used to create new Droids have been lost, so most Droids are heavily maintained pieces of machinery.

- **C3P-D0H:** An alcohol distillery robot. Knows 6 millions forms of distillation.
- **J4R-J4R:** Created as a child's mascot, but proved to be largely unpopular.

## PT-117
Professor Tablet 117 is the size of piece of paper and is as thick as a book. This droid is powered by an Aether Shard, and contains a colour screen, speakers, microphone, and camera. It's stats are 18 INT, 10 WIS, 7 CHA. It speaks and understands Gauldish, Draconic, and Common. It can be programmed with up to 3 additional languages by undergoing a training process.

PT-117 has hearing and sight of up to 18m, and has no will of it's own. Knows extensive information about Dragons, Vampires, Virology, and the Aetherdeck. This means it gets a +9 bonus to areas of it's expertise. PT-117 has a limited form of movement via in-built hoverjets.

PT-177 also has an extensive analysis of the ritualistic murder scene that occurred in the mines of Leadengold (where Ulrich first broke through between the realms). This can be used to gain advantage on rolls used to investigate the Blood Fang ritual.

He is currently staying with Krist on the outskirts of Dessingrove.

# Hentergrey Empire

He is a tall, thin and gaunt human male with wispy grey hair and sunken eyes that burst with intelligence.

# S.R.D (Special Research Division)

The S.R.D. are a special quasi-military group of the Hentergrey Empire, who have been tasked with acquiring and using ancient Gauldian tech for the benifit of the Empire. They are known by various different names based on the "S" (such as the Spectre Research Division), and a popular rumour within the Hentergrey military is because the division bought the embrodiered uniforms before settling on a name. The S.R.D is often in direct competition with the Bloodfangs for both resources and favour from the Emperor.

As with many tech hunters they are often found investigating ruins and are surprising adept at using Gauldian tech for combat purposes.

## Inquisitor Krieg

A member of the S.R.D’s Dessingrove group, and a proficient user of Gauldian combat technology. Krieg had discovered a Gauldian consciousness transfer unit, originally used on the Forged to transfer a consciousness from one body to the next. With some minor experimentation and tweaks, Krieg managed to separate the Specter from their user and trap it in a mechanical body. Supposedly this was to create obedient, unstoppable soldiers for the Hentigrey Army. The first successful transfer was Mark I, however the Specter retained their free will and broke free. The following Mark II units required a link to the Specter's original body to be controlled properly. If the Specter's mechanical body was destroyed without being physically linked back to their original body, both the Specter and the User would die.

## Grand Inquisitor Petrus

Potentially has a close connection to the Emperor, and could be in Dessingrove. They are usually based in Hirst, the capital of the Hentergrey Empire. Not much is known except that they have a high interest in the discovery of new Gauldian Technology.

# Collectors

Collectors aim to contain and preserve Gauldian technology, believing that it is dangerous in the wrong hands and that it caused the banishment of the Gauld to the Shadowrealm. By regulating and restricting access to Gauldian technology, the Collectors believe that the modern races can avoid a similar fate.

## Mandevrath Chapter

These Collectors were sent to Mandevrath to acertain whether it's secrets will be helpful to the Collector cause. The team includes two human Spectres (**Avervand** & **Pastance**), a Lacinum diplomat (**Nabur**), and two Orc guards (**Oska** & **Torge**).

## Dessingrove Chapter

The leader is the Lefantian Jerts Dina, a short fellow with sunken eyes and tattered ears. The public liason is the Teztec Chu'si Nateri, who has spottled emerald green skin and she is missing part of her left thumb. Jerts is ably assisted by the Forged Seidel Iteration 3, who has a bronze-coloured chassis that is engraved with decorative patterns.

### Spectrum

Spectrum is the leader of the Collectors, and is visiting Dessingrove on a '*Pilgrammage*'. His chassis is a sheeming coat of chrome, but with the obvious sign of wear and tear from centuries of use. His eyes burn bright, and he is constantly looking around his environment as if he is assessing each and every thing.

He has chosen to retain all of his memories instead of doing a fresh restart. This makes him seem to act slower and more lethargic than others of his kind, as his RAM and SWAP spaces are at full capacity and his memory subroutines are constantly trying to optimise his memory. To help the optimisation, he only speaks in Gauldian as most of his primary memories are in this ancient language.

# Kobolds of Koburg

The Kobolds are the half-dragon, half-gauld creations of the Mandevrath Science Team. They were subjected to experimentations that tested dragon-killing weapons.

The only Kobold city in all of Terrea is hidden underground, underneath the Gauldian ruins of Mandevrath. The elder Kobold who effectively runs the city is **Mudran**, uncle of the parties’ Kobold **Bamo**. Koburg is now effectively under the protection of the Collectors, who conduct their research on the secrets of Mandevrath and the Aetherdeck.

Kobolds saved from Kruxas were Mudran (leader), Praba, Vinda, and Bamo.
