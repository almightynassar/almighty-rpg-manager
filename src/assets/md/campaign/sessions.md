# Mandevrath Arc

## Session 1: Mandevrath

The party arrive at Mandevrath, where they encounter some Hentegrey army deserters and spiders. They quickly defeated all enemies and interrogate the survivors, learning about the Collector's interest in Mandevrath.

## Session 2: Droids

The party found themselves stuck in a room that eventually turned out to be a contamination cleansing process. They also discovered a few Droids which Raorik took an interest in.

## Session 3: The Collectors

The Collectors finally arrived at Mandevrath, and bargained with the party for ownership of the facility. This resulted in battle, where the party barely won. The party entered the final room, discovering a special type of spider that could phase through walls.

## Session 4: Mystery at Mandevrath

Raorik, Bendris and Geliah ventured deep into Mandevrath to find out secrets within. There were strange happenings within the walls of the underground where it appeared to be a laboratory. Further investigations lead the group to discover an ancient base to find a way to battle the Dragon threat. The denizens of Mandevrath developed biological warfare to stem the tide of the Dragon forces. In doing so they developed various Dragon-themed weaponry and found ways to bend space and time in secret rooms to further their reach. The group found the last door holding something within and stand ready venture forth.

## Session 5: Kruxas & Handeep

Having ascertained the murky nature of the tragedy that had befallen the researchers of Mandevrath, the party proceeded into the two-keycard sealed vault (that had been hereto unopened for potentially hundreds of years). As soon as the doors opened, they were presented with what appeared to be an attempted jailbreak - Kobolds had been enslaved by Vampire Kobolds (who were overseen by the three remaining surviving researchers who had become Vampires of their own). At that moment, only one Head Vampire was present alongside a handful of VK who were attempting to restrain and even kill the escaping Kobolds. The party leapt into action, and after a very nearly deadly battle, successfully killed the Head Vampire (who was identified as Kruxas) and the VK. They then freed the caged Kobolds, as well as a curiously Undead Spectral (whose powers were manifested through sheer will of vengeance), then set about planning for an expedition into the now-uncovered Kobold caves to free the remaining Kobolds (which potentially means slaying the Vampires).

## Session 6: Moixa and the Kobold Town

The party entered Koburg, the Kobold town underneath Mandevrath. They tried to stealthily enter, but instead started a kobold insurrection against their vampire masters. The vampires were eventually overwhelmed by the combined might of the party and the kobolds, and Moixa tried to use her shapeshifting ability to escape. The party saw through the ruse, and gave Handeep the revenge he craved for so long.

## Session 7: Into the Aetherdeck

Bendris, and his Kobold sidekick Bamo, went into the Aetherdeck to explore one of the artificial realities (code: 3-2-3). They were immediately greeted by a quaint village, and an argument between the village elder and a nobleman. They also met Ulrich Von Liectenstein, who constantly mentioned that they were a true and proper knight. They discovered that there were weird happenings in the village, where the miners were compelled to work or suffered spontaneous head combustion. Bendris, Bamo, and Ulrich visited the mine where they met a cultist priest. The Cultist priest showed the trio a portal that opened to a realm inhabited by an Eldritch being. The Eldritch demanded that the trio submit to it, but Bendris and Bamo were pulled out of the Aetherdeck, just in time....
