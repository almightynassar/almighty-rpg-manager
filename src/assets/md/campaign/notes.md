The following note was discovered on Sahntah before they were taken away by the Dragon:

## Army structure

The forces are structured as follows:

 - The **Marshal** is in charge of co-ordinating all of the nations forces
 - The **General** is in charge of an **Army** in the field, including camps & logistics. ~3-10 platoons.
 - The **Commander** is in charge of the **Garrison** forces within a city, castle, or other defendable point
 - An army is composed of one or more **Companies**, led by a **Captain**. ~3-10 platoons.
 - The **Lieutenant** is the 2nd-in-charge of a Company, and when not standing in for the Captain they are in charge of their own platoon
 - The **Sargeant** is in charge of a **Platoon**, which is the backbone of the army. ~60-160 men.
 - A **Patrol** is the smallest military unit, but is usually only formed on an ad-hoc basis for special purposes (such as scouting). They are led by an **Ensign** if no higher ranks are available. ~4-20 men.

The navy structure is as follows:

 - The **Admiral** is in charge of a **Fleet** of ships
 - The **Captain** is in charge of a single ship

## Aetherdeck instructions

Make sure you have enough power. Not sure what will happen to subjects inside the Aetherdeck if there is a blackout! We are not sure if the affect is an overlay on top of the room, or a transportation into a separate pocket dimension.

Simple have the subjects enter the aetherdeck and lock the room behind them. The aetherdeck must be completely sealed before it can function; any gaps and the effect is lost.

Key in the code into the panel and press start. The code consists of three numbers ranging from 1 - 3.

The room will operate for 30 mins until the automatic fail-safe kicks in and returns the Aetherdeck back to normal. The failsafe can be overridden, but please don't do this unless you are 100% sure what is on the other side.

## Aetherdeck tests.

Subjects exploring rooms. Code and results are given. Each room seems to reset on each new start.

- 1-1-1: Verdant farmland, always ripe for harvest.
- 1-1-2: Subjects never return.
- 1-1-3: Caves rich in metal ores.
- 1-1-4: Subjects never return.
- 3-2-3: Ulrich's Home (and the Eldritch Being)

Due to the loss of so many subjects to the Aetherdeck, we are suspending active exploration. We are looking at utilising droids manufactured upstairs to continue exploration.
