## Aetherdeck instructions

Make sure you have enough power. Not sure what will happen to subjects inside the Aetherdeck if there is a blackout! We are not sure if the affect is an overlay on top of the room, or a transportation into a separate pocket dimension.

Simple have the subjects enter the aetherdeck and lock the room behind them. The aetherdeck must be completely sealed before it can function; any gaps and the effect is lost.

Key in the code into the panel and press start. The code consists of three numbers ranging from 1 - 3.

The room will operate for 30 mins until the automatic fail-safe kicks in and returns the Aetherdeck back to normal. The failsafe can be overridden, but please don't do this unless you are 100% sure what is on the other side.

## Aetherdeck tests.

Subjects exploring rooms. Code and results are given. Each room seems to reset on each new start.

- 1-1-1: Verdant farmland, always ripe for harvest.
- 1-1-2: Subjects never return.
- 1-1-3: Caves rich in metal ores.
- 1-1-4: Subjects never return.

Due to the loss of so many subjects to the Aetherdeck, we are suspending active exploration. We are looking at utilising droids manufactured upstairs to continue exploration.
