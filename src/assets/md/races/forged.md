### Eternal Constructs

The Forged were created by the ancient Gauld to be cheap and disposable labour. But since the Forged were left behind when the Gauld passed into the Shadowrealm at the end of the Sundering, the machines left behind must now forge their own destiny.

### Memory Reset

Although the Forged can live forever, they do not have the storage capacity to keep all of their memories. While a Forged is able to selectively delete memories to free up new space, this has unintended consequences to the underlying personality of the Forged. Many Forged have found it easier to do a complete system reboot, and start fresh lives in their old body. A Forged can generally last 200 years on one set of memories before needed a reset.

Because the underlying operating systems of the Forged were made by the Gauld, the Forged have an innate understanding of Gauldian tech and systems.

### Elder Forged (sub-race)

Sesom the Wanderer, last of the Gauld, made a journey to Phalanxis in a hope to revive his lost brothers and sisters. Instead, all he found was more questions and the remaining Forged. In an attempt to continue his quest, Sesom modified many of the Forged to have increased memory storage and data processing capacity. These changes mean that the Elder Forged can "live" for longer, and many continue searching for answers on how to bring the Gauld back.
