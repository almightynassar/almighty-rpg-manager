### Home among the Ice

The icy continent of Snvert is where the Snvert race calls home. They learned how to hide from the dangerous Frost Trolls and the Orc raids, and created an incredible techological city of Snvert among the base of the mountains.

### Technologists

The Snvert discovered the Primordial ruin of Berylnn among the ice, and instantly the Snvert learned all they could about the technological wonders held within. They built their whole society around these devices, to the point that many Snvert worry about what will happen if the primordial essence ever runs out.
