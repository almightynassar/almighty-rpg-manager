### Deep Sea Fishfolk

Legends state that Locanth were created when Baltha, in the form of different fish, coupled with humans in a competition with Artra. The Locanth look more fish-like than their Merfolk bretheren, and inherited the ability to survive the ocean depths. The Locanth city of Ocearus is the only underwater city in the world.

### Conformists

The Locanth are noted to be generally conformist and do not go out of their way to cause a fuss. Both the Merfolk and Dwarves employ Locanth on their trading ships as reliable labour.

### Tireless Navigators

"A Locanth is never lost" is a common saying on Terrea. The city of Ocearus is known to have countless navigational and star charts, and many Locanth claim that they were the first to circumnavigate the globe.
