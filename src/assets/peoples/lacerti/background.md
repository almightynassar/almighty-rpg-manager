### Badland Wanderers

Legends claim that the Lacerti were created when Artra, in the form of different reptiles, coupled with humans. Lacertan thoughts are alien to the other races, and caused widespread unease. Eventually, many Lacerti decided to find a land of their own and underwent a pilgrammage that took them past Phalanxis and Al-Khaleeri. They eventually settled on the hot plains of the Naati Badlands.

### Competent Warriors

The Lacerti are a competitive race, and make capable warriors and hunters. Their win-at-all-cost attitude has often put them at odds with the other races

### Caste-based society

The nation of Illumi Naati was formed by humans and lacerti, and is segregated into different castes. Pure humans and lacerti are the lowest caste, while the lacinum are the highest.

### Lacinum: Eugenic Perfection

The Lacerti and Humans that settled on the Naati badlands thought they could create a superior race, and the result of their targeted breeding was the Lacinum. The goal is to perfectly blend human ingenuity with lacertan physicality, and any individual that is deemed to be close to this goal become highly revered.

When a Lacin (singular for Lacinum) is born, they immediately begin their education at the College of Speechcraft. There they learn about rhetoric, philosophy, and conflict resolution. Once they graduate, gifted Lacinum are posted all over Terrea with the goal of becoming diplomats and influencers.
