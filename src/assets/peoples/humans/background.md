### The Inheritors of the Gauld

Humans emerged from the World Center at around the time when the Gauld left Mid-Realm during the Sundering, and were welcomed by the sight of now empty cities and incomprehensible technological wonders. The remaining Gauld and Forged noted that the new Humans were physically smaller and less focused, but were cunning problem solvers and adaptable. Those who remained became to teach the newcomers what they could, eager to ensure that Gauld knowledge and culture would survive. Because of this, many humans consider themselves as the natural inheritors of the Gauldish Empire. Many legends claim that humans were created because the Gods were saddened by the destruction of the Gauld.

### Diversity and Flexibility

Humans are diverse in all senses of the word. There is no typical human, and they are by far the most ambitious and adaptable of the races. Their skin tones and hair colours range from light to dark, and are not regionally specific.
