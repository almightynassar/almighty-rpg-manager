Daemons are what the Gauld transformed into after they entered the Shadowrealm. The Shadowrealm is an empty, transient, timeless realm that meant that while the Gauld became essentially immortal they could not create or destroy. Without an outlet for their creativity and intelligence, the Gauld turned to modifying themselves using the limited access they had to the Aether.

Daemons are neither evil or good, as they generally do not share the same ethics or values as the sentient races of Terrea. They are jealous, however, and seek a way to return to Terrea.
