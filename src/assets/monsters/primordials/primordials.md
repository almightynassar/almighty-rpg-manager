Primordials are elemental beings that are intimately linked to the mythological figure of Primus. Primus was an immortal being that was there at the beginning of creation, and who shared knowledge of the Aether with the ancient Gauld. Some of the Gauld became disciples of Primus, and allowed their bodies to become conduits of elemental power.

As the Gauld passed into the Shadowrealm, the disciples of Primus devoted themselves fully to the elemental art. While the other Gauld turned into Daemons, the disciples began to embody the elements they studied.
