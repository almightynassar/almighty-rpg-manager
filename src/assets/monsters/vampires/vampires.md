# Vampires

Vampires were created by the Gods to assassinate powerful Gauldan Specters, as their powers mirror and counter the average Specter. They are able to blend into society easily, and use the Nether-sourced powers to drain the lifeforce and willpower of their targets. Vampires are considered to be undead monsters.

The party encountered and defeated two Vampires in the secret underground facility of Mandevrath (**Kruxas** and **Moixa**). However the head vampire, **Drafus Malfium**, is still at large.
