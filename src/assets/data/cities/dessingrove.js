    { title: 'Cultural Melting Pot', description: 'Dessingrove is a melting pot of multiple cultures, being the refuge of the three kingdoms defeated by the Empire. This has fostered cultural sharing in Dessingrove, which has made it a sort of a New Orleans (where African music fused with European concepts to create Blue, then Jazz, then Rock, etc). Dessingrove\'s local music scene borrows a lot of influence from the mix of Lefantian, Teztec (turtle), and Avian cultures.' }
