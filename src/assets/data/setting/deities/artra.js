    "The God of Aether and Creation, and the most chaotic and unpredicatable of the Gods. They delight in ideas and forms, and are always trying to come up with something 'new'. Followers of Artra try to emulate their God's creativity and inquisitiveness.",
    'Artra is the reason why there are so many mortal races in the Mid Realm, as they copulated with humans to create beastial hybrids. They were also the driving force behind the quantity and variety of monsters in Mid Guard, as they delighted in coming up with new and interesting ways to combat the ancient Gauldian threat.'
