    'The God of the Mid Realm and Balance, and is usually the mediator between the other two Gods. However they will only intervene if the status quo is under threat, preferring to care for mortals at a distance',
    'When the war between the Gods and the ancient Gauld threatened to destroy all of Terrea, it was Rulik who negotiated the peace and created the Shadowrealm. Because of his role of mediator, followers of Rulik try to emulate him through rhetoric and logic',
    'Rulik was also instrumental in the creation of the Specters, as they were worried about the unchecked potential of the wonderous technological devices powered by primordial essence. Specters allowed mortals to use Spectral abilities that matched the power of essence, and became crucial in maintaining a balance in the Mid Realm.'
