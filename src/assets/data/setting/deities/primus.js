    'Primus is technically not a God, but the first sentient being who eventually became the ruler of the Shadow Realm. An immortal with a direct connection to the Aether, Primus constantly found themselves opposed by Baltha. The God of Entropy could not stand the idea of a being escaping the Nether, and tried to hinder Primus wherever they could. This eventually led to Primus uniting the ancient Gauld and Primordials to rise up and try to overthrow the Gods, but their ultimate failure led to Primus being banished to the Shadow Realm.',
    'Primus is a controversial figure to the mortals of Terrea. Some see Primus as a tragic tale of wasted potential, a being gifted with limitless power that is squandered by pride and greed. To others, Primus is a freedom fighters and a symbol that the power of the Gods is not absolute.'
