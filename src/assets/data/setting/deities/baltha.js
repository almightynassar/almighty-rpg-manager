    "The God of Nether and Entropy, and the most dour and serious of the Gods. They desire that everything follows a defined and rigid plan, and will become annoyed when things do not play out as predicted. Followers of Baltha try to emulate their God's discipline and organisational skills.",
    'Baltha is seen as the steady hand that refines all life on Terrea, ensuring that everything created has a purpose. This, of course, regularly puts the God at odds with Artra, who desires to change everything.'
