    "Primus finally achieved creation without solely relying on the aether after the birth of the Primordial race with the help of the Primordialists. The Gauld took notes from this event and used it to drive their knowledge about creating fantastical devices powered by Primoridal shards, to the point that the Gauld essentially met or surpassed modern technology feats (they don't need electronics and computers when they have 'magic' power). So the Gauld were already on their way to achieving new heights, and Primus already felt left behind.",
    'Primus wanted everything, and to this end he believed there was only one solution; Godhood. But they could not achieve this alone, and so Primus secretly sought help from allies among the Gauld. This was kept hidden, because there was already tensions (and sometimes outright violence) between Gauld factions. Primus headed a massive world-wide conspiracy with one goal; how to turn someone into a God.',
    'But the conspiracy was eventually discovered, and the Gods immediately went on the offensive. But Primus was not alone this time, as their Gauld allies had created terrible and awe-inspiring machines that allowed them to hold their own against the Gods. The battles raged across the world, and it became an arms race between the two sides. Artra and Baltha created increasingly deadly monsters and devastating plagues to ravage the Gauld and PrimordialS, while the mortals invented new devices and weapons of war to keep up.',
    "Only Rulik abstained from the fighting, horrified at what has befallen to Terrea. Rulik only decided to act near the end, when Artra and Baltha created a disease that sterilized it's host instead of killing them, allowing the invisible disease to spread and infect the whole mortal population before being detected. As a retaliation, the mortals sought to tear the realms apart in a dying bid to get even with the Gods. Rulik could stand aside no longer, and he sought an audience with Primus.",
    "Rulik offered to delicately sunder the Mid-Realm into two distinct pieces, and offer ownership of one half as a sanctuary for the Primus and their allies. Mid-Realm would remain, but it will have a twin that follows in it's shadow. And, more importantly, it would be kept away from the clutches of Artra and Baltha. Primus reluctantly agreed; it was not complete Godhood, but it was an existence. The other Gods were infuriated at first when they learned of Rulik's deal, but relented when they learned that the Sundering would strip some of the potency in primoridal magics to create the new realm, ensuring that mortals would never again achieve the feats of the Gauld.",
    'When the Sundering was complete, the Primus traded his connection to the aether for direct control of the new Shadowrealm. He named it Sanctuary, and his allies began to pass into Sanctuary. The passage left behind more than just their bodies, and they became the Spirits, Daemons and Shadows of the Shadowrealm. They remember only a part of what they used to be, and no longer concerned themselves about matters of the flesh. All except the Primus, who since their birth was spited by the Gods. He secretly kept a private oath that they would all return, and that Primus would take the Godhood that they believe was rightly theirs.',
    'Some of the Gauld stayed behind, even though they were sterilized and doomed as a race. They were mainly the Specters, who saw the Gauld who followed Primus as foolish and wanted to pass into the nether as normal. These Gauld worked tirelessly to ensure that a part of Gauld culture survived in Terrea, and to maybe pass on the secrets of Specters to a worthy heir.'
