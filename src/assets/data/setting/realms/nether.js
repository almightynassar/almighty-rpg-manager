    'The Nether is the realm of entropy, death, finality, apathy, and certainty. It is where all things go when they die, the final chapter of their story. No matter what type of life you lived, whether you were a force for good or evil, it is certain that you will end up in the Nether.',
    'Resurrection is possible in Terrea, although difficult, because all things exist forever in the Nether. The soul must be willing and able to return, and must be able to inhabit a functional body. However, a resurrection may incur the wrath of Baltha, God of the Nether.'
