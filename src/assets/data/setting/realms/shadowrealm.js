    'The Shadow Realm is where the ancient Gauldian and Primordial races retreated to after their struggle with the Gods, led by the powerful immortal Primus. As they left their mortal bodies behind they became the Spirits and Daemons that inhabit the Shadow Realm. It is a realm that is a mere shadow of the others, and it evokes a feeling of dread, pity, and vengence.',
    'The Shadow Realm was split from the Mid Realm in an event called the Sundering, and it was formed out of the primordial essence that powered the magical technology of the Gauld. Because primoridal essence is a key ingredient of magic in Terrea, those who use it are thought to have ties with the Shadow Realm.'
