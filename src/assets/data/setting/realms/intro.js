    'The Realms of Terrea are the Aether, Nether, Mid Realm, and Shadow Realm. They are overlapping realities that interact with each other, and some mortals claim to be able to shift between them. Denizens of the other realms can see into the overlapped Mid Realm, although the Mid Realm will appear to be muted and blurry to them.',
    "Normally, creatures can't attack other creatures located in a different realm. Creatures in any of the realms will appear to be invisible and utterly silent to someone in the overlapped Mid Realm, and solid objects in the overlapped Mid Realm do not hamper the movement of creatures in the other realms. There are exceptions for some magical effects and beings such as Specters.",
    'The World Center in the Mid Realm is a special place where the boundaries between the realms are especially thin. This allows denizens from any of the realms to shift across to a different realm with ease.'
