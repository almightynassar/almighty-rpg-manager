## Background

- Grew up as an orphan, and didn't really fit in
- I make friends easily, but don't expect them to stick around for long
- I love to understand the nature how things work
- Wants to find interesting tech and go send them home via S.N.V.E.R.T (Snvert New Viable Essence Retrieval Team)
- Has a particular interest in MI and Machine Souls
- **Ideal: Community**. We have to take care of each other, because no one else will
- **Bond**. Snvert is my home, and I must save it
- **Flaw**. Most people fear ancient destructive technology. I stop and take notes
