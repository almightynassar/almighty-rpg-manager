## Personality

### Traits

I love to understand the nature how things work.

I make friends easily, but don't expect them to stick around for long.

Wants to find interesting tech and go home. Has a particular interest in MI and Machine Souls. Knows that there are SNVERT bases around that can transport tech back home.

Was an orphan, and didn't really fit in.

### Ideals

Community: We have to take care of each other, because no one else will.

### Bonds

Snvert is my home, and I must save it.

### Flaws

Most people fear ancient destructive technology. I stop and take notes.
