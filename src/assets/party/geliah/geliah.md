Geliah Sivvith was just a young recruit to the new forces being trained in the southern city of Kelerak when his life was irrevocably changed in the space of a day. Pulled off the street by hooded thugs, inexplicably tortured to within an inch of his life seemingly solely for their pleasure, Geliah survived thanks to an unknown dormant metaphysical ability awakening from deep within him and allowing him to escape.

He now travels the world in search of life and adventure beyond the provincial, as well as to seek further information about his newfound ability, and justice for his suffering.
