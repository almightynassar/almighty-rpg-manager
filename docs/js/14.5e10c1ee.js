The insidious pursuit of self-enrichment by the patrician class grew only more pervasive through the long centuries, and in the end left the body politic feckless and corrupt. The ambitious nobility sought only status and opportunity, and were unwavering in their exploitation of the outer regions for resources.\r\n> \r\n> The reason our Imperial court was able to avoid the dark waters that characterized the terminal years of the Three Kingdoms is that they have never been interested in status or self-glorification. On the contrary, they have been tireless in their devotion to unify Midrealm and assure the well-being of its myriad populations. Now, by partitioning the empire into regions, we actually achieve a unity previously absent; where once our loyalties and allegiances were divided, they now serve one goal: a cohesive world in which everyone prospers. Under the Imperial court our governors will not be working solely to enrich the patrician class, but to advance the quality of life in the regions that make up each state. It is through this system that the Empire improves every region it touches, judged by any metric you use: safety, prosperity, peace.\r\n> \r\n> Now, this bold vision of the future requires not only the service of those of immaculate reputation and consummate skill in the just exercise of power, but also the service of a vast military dedicated to upholding the laws necessary to ensure harmony. It may appear to some that the enactment of universal laws and the widespread deployment of a heavily armed military are steps toward world domination, but these actions are taken merely to protect us from those who would invade, enslave, exploit, or foment political dissent, and to punish accordingly any who engage in such acts. Look on our military not as trespassers or interlopers, but as gatekeepers, here to shore up the Emperor's vision of a prosperous world.\r\n> \r\n> I, Magistrate Mofkeen, have been mandated by the Emperor to bring this vision to you and to help you enact it within the colonies of Orland. The Emperor does not ask for your fealty, but only a cessation of hostilities so that we may all prosper together.\r\n\r\n# Mandevrath\r\n\r\n## Aetherdeck instructions\r\n\r\nMake sure you have enough power. Not sure what will happen to subjects inside the Aetherdeck if there is a blackout! We are not sure if the affect is an overlay on top of the room, or a transportation into a separate pocket dimension.\r\n\r\nSimple have the subjects enter the aetherdeck and lock the room behind them. The aetherdeck must be completely sealed before it can function; any gaps and the effect is lost.\r\n\r\nKey in the code into the panel and press start. The code consists of three numbers ranging from 1 - 3.\r\n\r\nThe room will operate for 30 mins until the automatic fail-safe kicks in and returns the Aetherdeck back to normal. The failsafe can be overridden, but please don't do this unless you are 100% sure what is on the other side.\r\n\r\n## Aetherdeck tests.\r\n\r\nSubjects exploring rooms. Code and results are given. Each room seems to reset on each new start.\r\n\r\n- 1-1-1: Verdant farmland, always ripe for harvest.\r\n- 1-1-2: Subjects never return.\r\n- 1-1-3: Caves rich in metal ores.\r\n- 1-1-4: Subjects never return.\r\n- 3-2-3: Ulrich's Home (and the Eldritch Being)\r\n\r\nDue to the loss of so many subjects to the Aetherdeck, we are suspending active exploration. We are looking at utilising droids manufactured upstairs to continue exploration.\r\n",s={name:"Notes",data:function(){return{markdown:a}}},i=s,h=r("2877"),l=Object(h["a"])(i,n,o,!1,null,null,null);t["default"]=l.exports}}]);
