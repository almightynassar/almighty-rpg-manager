They are beyond the issues of morality that plagues mortals, and cannot be described as either good or evil. They are driven to do both wonderful and terrible things, and are the driving force behind many of the important moments and myths of Terrea.\n\nThey are also capracious and fickle beings, each seeking to become the main divine force in Terrea and rule over the other gods. The unspoken rule of this competition is to never do anything that would threaten the existence of the realms or the Gods.\n\nWhile technically not a deity in the classic sense, Primus is sometimes considered worthy of worship by mortals. Followers are usually drawn to the ideals of freedom, independence, and self-realistion. Opponents to Primus argue that the immortal represents self-indulgent pride and hubris\n\n## Artra\n\nThe God of Aether and Creation, and the most chaotic and unpredicatable of the Gods. They delight in ideas and forms, and are always trying to come up with something 'new'. Followers of Artra try to emulate their God's creativity and inquisitiveness.\n\nArtra is the reason why there are so many mortal races in the Mid Realm, as they copulated with humans to create beastial hybrids. They were also the driving force behind the quantity and variety of monsters in Mid-Realm, as they delighted in coming up with new and interesting ways to combat the ancient Gauldian threat.\n\n - Beginnings\n - Birth\n - Chaos\n - Conception of terrible weapons\n - Craftsmen\n - Creation\n - Disasters\n - Discovery\n - Farming\n - Harvest\n - Ideas\n - Imagination\n - Monsters\n\n## Baltha\n\nThe God of Nether and Entropy, and the most dour and serious of the Gods. They desire that everything follows a defined and rigid plan, and will become annoyed when things do not play out as predicted. Followers of Baltha try to emulate their God's discipline and organisational skills.\n\nBaltha is seen as the steady hand that refines all life on Terrea, ensuring that everything created has a purpose. This, of course, regularly puts the God at odds with Artra, who desires to change everything.\n\n - Bureacracy\n - Concealment\n - Death\n - Destruction\n - Discipline\n - Doctrine\n - Endings\n - Entropy\n - Fate\n - History\n - Law & legislation\n - Order\n - Resolution\n\n## Rulik\n\nThe God of the Mid Realm and Balance, and is usually the mediator between the other two Gods. However they will only intervene if the status quo is under threat, preferring to care for mortals at a distance.\n\nWhen the war between the Gods and the ancient Gauld threatened to destroy all of Terrea, it was Rulik who negotiated the peace and created the Shadowrealm. Because of his role of mediator, followers of Rulik try to emulate him through rhetoric and logic.\n\nRulik was also instrumental in the creation of the Specters, as they were worried about the unchecked potential of the wonderous technological devices powered by primordial essence. Specters allowed mortals to use Spectral abilities that matched the power of essence, and became crucial in maintaining a balance in the Mid Realm.\n\n - Balance\n - Diplomacy\n - Healing\n - Humility\n - Life\n - Mediation\n - Moderation\n - Nature\n - Redemption\n - Rhetoric\n - Sheperds\n - Specters\n - Status quo\n - Turning a blind eye\n - Willpower\n\n## Primus\n\nPrimus is technically not a God, but the first sentient being who eventually became the ruler of the Shadow Realm. An immortal with a direct connection to the Aether, Primus constantly found themselves opposed by Baltha. The God of Entropy could not stand the idea of a being escaping the Nether, and tried to hinder Primus wherever they could. This eventually led to Primus uniting the ancient Gauld and Primordials to rise up and try to overthrow the Gods, but their ultimate failure led to Primus being banished to the Shadow Realm.\n\nPrimus is a controversial figure to the mortals of Terrea. Some see Primus as a tragic tale of wasted potential, a being gifted with limitless power that is squandered by pride and greed. To others, Primus is a freedom fighters and a symbol that the power of the Gods is not absolute.\n\n - Free-will\n - Freedom\n - Independence\n - Knowledge\n - Power\n - Pride\n - Technology\n",o='# Magic\n\n## Primordial / Elemental\n\nPrimodial (or Elemental) magic is powered through the use of **Shards**. Shards are crystalline minerals that contain pure Aether energy, and can be found in abundant supply on Terrea. Shards were used by the ancient Gauld as an energy source for their technology to manipulate reality in different ways. In other words, Shards are the "batteries" that power Primordial techonology to create magical effects.\n\nBecause Shards were created by the Primordials, the allies to the ancient Gauld in their war against the Gods, Primordial magic is often associated with the Shadowrealm.\n\nModern Artificiers use the Shards they find to power technological marvels, which drives the economy in some nations.\n\n## Spectral\n\nThe most common form of magic that is found on Terrea. An individual can draw upon the Aether directly using sheer willpower to create Spectral effects, however this process is very taxing on the mind and body. Spectral abilities are generally limited in scope, and is related in some form to the individual\'s personality, physicality, or emotional state.\n\nThe only beings able to fully unlock the power of Spectral magic are the Specters. Specters are able to manifest an avatar in the Aether realm, and this manifestation allows the Specter to draw upon the Aether directly without suffering ill-effects. However, most Specters are created during a near-death or other traumatic experience. Some scholars postulate that this extreme experience forces the Specter to concentrate their willpower in such a way as to call their avatar into existence. \n\nOther individuals can have limited access to Spectral abilities, such as the abilities of Barbarians, Monks, and Clerics. Their willpower is strong enough to draw upon the Aether directly without suffering ill-effects.\n\n## Natural\n\nNatural magic relies on the fact that all lifeforce is created by the Aether. Whereas Primordial magic uses Shards as their "batteries", Natural magic instead uses organisms as the source of their abilities. There is a risk that using organisms in this manner will drain the life out of them, and killing an organism in this manner is highly frowned upon by practitioners.\n\nThis source of power is mainly used by the Druids.\n',s="# Realms\n\nThe Realms of Terrea are the Aether, Nether, Mid Realm, and Shadow Realm. They are overlapping realities that interact with each other, and some mortals claim to be able to shift between them. Denizens of the other realms can see into the overlapped Mid Realm, although the Mid Realm will appear to be muted and blurry to them.\n\nNormally, creatures can't attack other creatures located in a different realm. Creatures in any of the realms will appear to be invisible and utterly silent to someone in the overlapped Mid Realm, and solid objects in the overlapped Mid Realm do not hamper the movement of creatures in the other realms. There are exceptions for some magical effects and beings such as Specters.\n\nThe World Center in the Mid Realm is a special place where the boundaries between the realms are especially thin. This allows denizens from any of the realms to shift across to a different realm with ease.\n\n## Aether\n\nThe Aether is the realm of creation, beginnings, imagination, willpower, and possibilities. It is where all creatures, monsters, and objects were created before entering into the Mid Realm. It is powered equally by the pleasant dreams of the content as it is by the nightmares of the tormented.\n\nIt is also the realm of the Specters, the astral manifestation of willpower. Specters are tied to the mortal who created it, and can directly interact with the Mid Realm to produce powerful magical effects. When the mortal dies, so does their Specter.\n\n## Mid-Realm\n\nThe Mid Realm is the experienced reality of mortals. It is where all existence is played out, after they are gifted with a life by the Aether until that life is claimed by the Nether. This is where all adventures will be played out.\n\n## Nether\n\nThe Nether is the realm of entropy, death, finality, apathy, and certainty. It is where all things go when they die, the final chapter of their story. No matter what type of life you lived, whether you were a force for good or evil, it is certain that you will end up in the Nether.\n\nResurrection is possible in Terrea, although difficult, because all things exist forever in the Nether. The soul must be willing and able to return, and must be able to inhabit a functional body. However, a resurrection may incur the wrath of Baltha, God of the Nether.\n\n## Shadow Realm\n\nThe Shadow Realm is where the ancient Gauldian and Primordial races retreated to after their struggle with the Gods, led by the powerful immortal Primus. As they left their mortal bodies behind they became the Spirits and Daemons that inhabit the Shadow Realm. It is a realm that is a mere shadow of the others, and it evokes a feeling of dread, pity, and vengence.\n\nThe Shadow Realm was split from the Mid Realm in an event called the Sundering, and it was formed out of the primordial essence that powered the magical technology of the Gauld. Because primoridal essence is a key ingredient of magic in Terrea, those who use it are thought to have ties with the Shadow Realm.\n",l={name:"Cosmologies",data:function(){return{markdown:{deities:r,magic:o,realms:s},tabs:[{id:"deities",name:"Deities",icon:"game-icon:angel-wings"},{id:"magic",name:"Magic",icon:"game-icon:magic-swirl"},{id:"realms",name:"Realms",icon:"game-icon:magic-portal"}],tab:"deities"}},beforeRouteUpdate(e,t,a){this.tab=e.params.id,a()},mounted(){this.tab=this.$router.currentRoute.params.id}},h=l,d=a("2877"),c=a("429b"),m=a("7460"),u=a("adad"),f=a("823b"),p=a("eebe"),w=a.n(p),y=Object(d["a"])(h,n,i,!1,null,null,null);t["default"]=y.exports;w()(y,"components",{QTabs:c["a"],QTab:m["a"],QTabPanels:u["a"],QTabPanel:f["a"]})}}]);
