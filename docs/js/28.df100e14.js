Each realm is ruled over by a temperamental and fickle [God](/#/cosmology/deities), who are constantly bickering with each other. The Gods are not bound by mortal ethics and morality, and are solely concerned with protecting their realms and their power. The Gods rarely intefere in the lives of mortals.\r\n\r\nThe first sentient peoples were the ancient Gauld, and they were intelligent and cunning. They flourished all across Mid-Realm by creating many wonders and reaching cultural heights that drew the attention of the immortal [Primus](/#/cosmology/deities), the creator and source of magical Essence. Primus and the Gauld eventually rose up against the Gods, and the Gods retaliated by birthing the monsters that are now endemic to Terrea. The Gods eventually triumphed, and they banished the Gauld and Primus to the [Shadow Realm](/#/cosmology/realms). The ruins and technology of the Gauld remained behind, reminders of what once was.\r\n\r\nAs adventurers in Terrea you can choose to fight back against the monstrous terrors that plague the good and honest citizens, or delve deep into ancient ruins and plunder their powerful secrets. You can take part in the politics of the day, making sure that the people are well-looked after or bowing down in servitude to their betters. You can join the struggle alongside [freedom fighters](/#/nations/partisans), stand firm with the [Hentergrey Empire](/#/nations/hentergrey) to maintain order, or go plundering with Orcish raiders. And if that all seems too grand for you, simply try to make an honest living as a humble adventurer that will eventually settle down with family and friends.\r\n",i={name:"Home",data:function(){return{markdown:o}}},s=i,l=n("2877"),d=Object(l["a"])(s,a,r,!1,null,null,null);t["default"]=d.exports}}]);
