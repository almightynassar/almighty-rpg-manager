However, there are some earth creatures that can be found natively in Terrea:\n\n - Birds\n - Domesticated animals (Cattle, Chickens, Pigs, Sheep)\n - Fish\n - Horses (Levengeti and World Center)\n - Insects\n - Rodents (Rabbits, Rats, Mice, Squirrels)\n - Snakes & Lizards\n - Spiders\n\n *NB: The crystal caves of Crystalis are home to mostly fungus, insects, and small rodents*\n\n| Species | Regions | Description |\n| ------- | ------- | ----------- |\n| Batterflies | Levengeti, Orland, Shattered Isles, Tauria, Tezonian Jungle, Treasure Islands, World Center | A tiny colourful bat-like herbivore that feeds off plants using their probiscus. They are considered important pollinators. |\n| Boarcupine | World Center | A medium omnivore that is a highly aggresive cross between a boar and a porcupine. The boarcupine has two tusks, a pig-like snout, and an array of sharp quills that covers it's body. |\n| Camex | Azia Desert, Bounty | A large herbivorous dromodery that has large humps of fat on it's back and two large horns. A cross between the Camel and the Ibex. |\n| Cariffalo | Snvert, Tauria | A large herbivore that has the stout body of a buffalo, with the antlers and snout of a Caribou (reindeer). |\n| Catowl | Azia Desert, Bounty, Levengeti, Naati, Orland, Shattered Isles, Tauria, Tezonian Jungle, Treasure Islands, World Center | A small four-legged bird with a feline face and paws that comes in many varieties. The claws are retractable, and makes a distinctive and bizarre moew-hoot. |\n| Cranefish | Orland, Shattered Isles, Treasure Islands, World Center | A small streamlined bird that has scales covering most of it's body (except the wings, which are feathered). Partially amphibious, and mostly eats fish. |\n| Frorrel | Tezonian Jungle | A tiny, furry, and amphibious creature that eats insects, nuts, and berries. Known to be quick climbers and long jumpers. |\n| Goatilla  | Tezonian Jungle | A large omnivorous ape that has horns, snout and shaggy wool. Very placid, but dangerous when provoked. |\n| Komino  | Levengeti | A large omnivorous lizard with a large horn on it's snout and a thick hide. A cross between the Komodo dragon and rhino. |\n| Otguin  | Snvert | A small flightless water mammal that has the body of a penguin and the head of an otter. They are adept swimmers, and mostly hunt fish. |\n| Pandalion  |  | A large black-and white omnivore that generally eats shoots and leaves, but is known to hunt prey. Has a furry mane. |\n| Rabaroo | Azia Desert, Levengeti | A medium bipedal herbivore that has floppy ears and large hind legs. It carries it's young in a pouch in it's front. |\n| Sparrowkeet | Levengeti, Naati, Orland, Shattered Isles, Tezonian Jungle, Treasure Islands, World Center | A tiny colourful bird that has a pleasant bird-call. |\n| Springbull | Levengeti | A large horned herbivore. It is a cross between a bull and a springbok. It can leap quickly, despite it's size. |\n| Vultasp | Bounty | A small scavenger bird that has a poisonous sting. |\n| Yakmel  | Snvert, Tauria | A large herbivore that has thick fur, a fatty hump, stout body, and a long neck. The yakmel stores extra fat in it's humps, enabling it to go without food or water for long periods. |\n",i="| Plant | Edible? | Regions |\n| ----- | ------- | ------- |\n| Alfafa | Y | Naati Badlands, Tauria |\n| Almonds | Y | Naati Badlands, Tauria |\n| Aniseed | Y | Levengeti |\n| Apples | Y | World Center |\n| Apricots | Y | Shattered Isles |\n| Artichokes | Y | World Center |\n| Asparagus | Y | Naati Badlands,Tauria |\n| Asparagus | Y | World Center |\n| Avacado | Y | Orland |\n| Bananas | Y | Treasure Islands |\n| Barley | Y | Levengeti, Tauria |\n| Beans | Y | Orland |\n| Blueberries | Y | Orland |\n| Cabbages | Y | Levengeti, Shattered Isles, Snvert Island, World Center |\n| Cacao (Cocoa Beans) | Y | Orland, Tezonian Jungle |\n| Carrots | Y | Tauria, World Center |\n| Cassava | Y | Tezonian Jungle |\n| Cherries | Y | Naati Badlands, Tauria |\n| Chickpeas | Y | Levengeti, Tauria, Treasure Islands |\n| Chilli peppers | Y | Tezonian Jungle |\n| Cinnamon | Y | Shattered Isles, Treasure Islands |\n| Clover | Y | Naati Badlands, Tauria, Treasure Islands, World Center |\n| Coconuts | Y | Treasure Islands |\n| Coffee | Y | Levengeti |\n| Corn (Maize) | Y | Orland, Tezonian Jungle |\n| Cranberries | Y | Orland |\n| Cucumber | Y | Shattered Isles, Treasure Islands |\n| Cumin | Y | Levengeti |\n| Dates | Y | Levengeti, Treasure Islands |\n| Eggplant | Y | Shattered Isles, Treasure Islands |\n| Fava Beans | Y | Tauria |\n| Figs | Y | World Center |\n| Fungi | Y | Bounty, Crystalis |\n| Garlic | Y | Naati Badlands |\n| Ginger | Y | Treasure Islands |\n| Grapefruit | Y | Shattered Isles |\n| Grapes | Y | Levengeti |\n| Hazelnuts | Y | Naati Badlands, Tauria, World Center |\n| Honey | Y | World Center |\n| Hops | Y | Levengeti, Naati Badlands, Shattered Isles, Tauria, World Center |\n| Leeks | Y | World Center |\n| Lemon | Y | Shattered Isles |\n| Lentils | Y | Tauria |\n| Lettuce | Y | Naati Badlands, World Center |\n| Mangos | Y | Treasure Islands |\n| Melons | Y | Shattered Isles, Treasure Islands |\n| Moss | Y | Bounty, Crystalis |\n| Mushrooms | Y | Bounty, Crystalis, Snvert Icelands |\n| Mustard Seeds | Y | World Center |\n| Olives | Y | Azia, Levengeti |\n| Onions | Y | Naati Badlands, Tauria |\n| Oranges | Y | Shattered Isles |\n| Papayas | Y | Orland, Tezonian Jungle |\n| Parsely | Y | Levengeti |\n| Peaches | Y | Shattered Isles |\n| Peanuts | Y | Tezonian Jungle |\n| Peas | Y | Azia, Tauria, World Center |\n| Peppercorn | Y | Azia |\n| Pigeonpeas | Y | Treasure Islands |\n| Pineapple | Y | Tezonian Jungle |\n| Pumpkin | Y | Orland, Tezonian Jungle |\n| Rice | Y | Shattered Isles, Treasure Islands |\n| Rye | Y | Levengeti, Naati Badlands, Tauria |\n| Sesame Seeds | Y | Azia |\n| Sorghum | Y | Azia, Bounty |\n| Soyabean | Y | Shattered Isles |\n| Spinach | Y | Naati Badlands, Tauria |\n| Strawberries | Y | Orland |\n| Sugar Beets | Y | World Center |\n| Sugarcane | Y | Treasure Islands |\n| Sumac | Y | Azia |\n| Sweet Potato | Y | Tezonian Jungle |\n| Taro root | Y | Shattered Isles |\n| Tea | Y | Shattered Isles, Treasure Islands |\n| Vanilla | Y | Orland, Tezonian Jungle |\n| Watermelon | Y | Treasure Islands |\n| Wheat | Y | Tauria, World Center |\n| Yams | Y | Tezonian Jungle, Treasure Islands |\n",o='Terrea is a small planet, with a unique feature being that the southern poles are covered in active volcanos that are constantly erupting. There is speculation that this high-level of volcanic activity may have something to do with the intersection of the Realms. Another curiousity is that the volcanoes do not emit as much material during eruption, and instead they serve as a sort of "heater" for the southern regions. The only exception is the region of Bounty, which is so close to the volcanoes that they experience regular blackouts of the sky and is covered in ash. However, the volcanic material makes the land extremely fertile leading to a constantly boom-bust cycle.\n\nThe volcanic activity means that the air currents generally originate from the south pole, travelling in a north-west direction. This air current and high temperatures means that the Treasure Islands and Tezonian Jungle regions constantly experience high levels of rainfall, and are therefore rich in diverse life. The Tezonian mountain ranges ensure most of the rainfall falls on the jungle, but some makes it past into the Girth Marshes. Finally, the air currents travel eastwards across the Levengeti and then across the World Center and the Shattered Isles. The air current are able to pick up moisture from the rivers and coasts in the Levengeti, meaning that the eastern regions is able to experience more rainfall.\n\nThe smaller volcanic activity in the Naati Badlands dictates the air currents of the northern hemisphere, but these are overshadowed by the power of the southern currents. The Azia Desert will experience some of it\'s rainfall due to these northerly winds, but the southerly air currents that make it across the Azia mountains generally keeps the rainfall along the northern coasts. Instead, Tauria experiences most of this rainfall.\n\n| Region | Biome | Temperature |  Rainfall | Description |\n| ------ | ------- | ----------- | --------- | ----------- |\n| Azia Desert | Cold desert | Hot summers and cold winters | Infrequent | A cold and dry region that hosts ever shifting sand dunes. |\n| Bounty | Hot and ashy desert | Hot all year around | Seasonal | Surrounded by active volcanos that constantly cover the land with ash and debris. |\n| Cystalis | Rocky desert | Cool to Cold | Infrequent | A continent that is completely covered in crystal-like substance. |\n| Girth Marshes | Temperate | Average | Regular to Frequent | A wet region that borders the Tropical and Temperate zones. |\n| Levengeti | Savanna | Dry, Temperate | Regular | A geologically stable region that is dominated by flat plains and tall grasses. |\n| Naati Badlands | Mediterranean | Extreme temperatures | Regular | A region of extremes due to the active volcanos and proximity to the artic north. |\n| Orland | Grassland | Avergae | Regular | An island nation that has varied biomes such as forests and grasslands. |\n| Shattered Isles | Temperate | Average | Regular | Islands that do not get as much rainfall as their tropical cousins, the Treasure Islands. |\n| Snvert Icelands | Tundra | Cold | Regular | The land is constantly covered with ice and snow, with some respite during the peak of summer. |\n| Tauria | Coniferous | Cool to Cold | Regular | A cold region, with the north frequently covered in snow. |\n| Tezonian Jungle | Tropical | Hot and Humid | Frequent | A hot and humid region that is teeming with natural life |\n| Treasure Islands | Tropical | Hot and Humid | Frequent | Tropical islands that are desirable for their constant warm weather and central location to trade hubs. |\n| World Center | Temperate | Average | Regular | The center of Terrea has a temperate climate that is dominated by the Twin Peaks mountains.
