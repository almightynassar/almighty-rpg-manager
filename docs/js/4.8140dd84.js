All three are necessary and complement each other. And so, the world is composed of three equal parts; the aether, the Mid-Realm, and the nether.

And the nether is where all things must end, either remembered or forgotten, and is known as the plane of entropy and decay.","Each of these realms overlap each other, as they are different aspects of the same entity. No realm could exist on it’s own, and the realms became mirrors of each other. Where a mountain is formed in one realm, it will then appear in the others. ","Each of the planes began to express wills and desires of their own, and these wills became the Gods of the planes. Artra ruled over the aether, Rulik held dominion over the Mid-Realm, and Baltha watched over the nether. The Gods initially agreed to keep everything in balance and that all life must have a beginning, a midwsdle, and an end. But, as with all creatures that have wills and desires, they began to scheme and plot and lust after power.","As life was beginning to arrive in Mid-Realm, starting at the World-Center, Artra stealthily created Primus on an island hidden to the south, which is now known as The Blight. Primus had direct access to all of the creative energies of the aether, and could not die. This greatly angered Baltha, and the god then began to try and suck Primus out of Mid-Realm and into the nether. But Primus resisted, and drew upon the aether directly to keep them bound to Mid-Realm. The battle between Baltha and Primus cast a sickness on the island, and all lifeforms became blighted and diseased. All except the region around Primus, kept healthy by residual energy from the aether.","The battle lasted for centuries, but eventually Baltha relented. But in their fury, the lord of the nether struck a hole in the World-Center, thinning the fabric between the Mid-Realm and the other realms. If Artra was to have Primus, then Baltha would leave his mark on the World-Center. Baltha then raised up two mountains to symbolise the duality of life and death, and as a passive-aggressive reminder to the other Gods that with every beginning there must come an end."]},G={id:"gauldan",name:"The Gauldan Age",paragraphs:["Rulik, not to be outdone by the other Gods, decides to create a people that embody Mid-Realm and it’s transient nature. Rulik fashioned the Gauld, and they emerged out of the thinning of the barrier between realms at the World-Center. They are a mortal race and, unlike Primus, they could reproduce and multiply. They are humanoid in appearance, but slightly larger than humans. Rulik gifted them with knowledge, and imbued them with the knowledge to craft tools and a desire to forge their own stories by changing the world around them to suit their needs. Baltha was appeased that the Gauld would end up in the nether when their story was done, and did not object. But Artra was offended that the Gauld could create without the aether, and secretly despised Rulik’s creation.","Primus, now free from battle with Baltha, could feel the creation of the Gauld through the aether. He left The Blight and journeyed towards the World-Center so that he could meet the Gauld. It was a positive encounter for both parties, as Primus taught the Gauld the secrets of agriculture and the Gauld showed Primus how to create without using aether. Upon the meeting spot, the Gauld fashioned the first great city of Hirst where the Gauld and Primus lived in harmony.","From the city of Hirst, the Gauld made great leaps in science and knowledge. They furthered their knowledge in maths, science, construction and agriculture. All of these advancements allowed the Gauld to spread across the different lands. They were even able to harness the power of Primordial Shards that was harvested byPrimus on their behalf from the aether, and could imbue their tools with special properties.","During this golden age, the Gauld were able to fashion an artificial sentient being called the Forged. They fashion bodies made of metal and stone, and crafted Primordial Shards in such a specific way that the metal bodies were able to come to life. The Forged have memories of their own, and are able to reason and create just like their builders."]},q={id:"essence",name:"Age of Essence",paragraphs:["But as the Gauld were progressing and advancing, Primus was beginning to feel Artra’s jealousy of the Gauld. Primus was limited to creating ‘miracles’ through their direct connection with the aether, and was feeling stagnant. Primus wanted to create as the Gauld did. To that end the immortal was able to gather up a devoted following who saw Primus as a God, calling themselves the Primordialists. Primus then left Hirst with his followers, travelling to a nearby land and creating a new city called Citadel.","In the Citadel, Primus experimented on the Primordialists in an attempt to create something new. They achieved this by eventually fusing primordial essence into a Gauld, creating the first Primordials. Each new primordial only had a limited connection with the aether and could only control a part of the natural world. But the Primordials also inherited mortality and reproduction from the Gauld, and could propagate their species. The Primordials soon set out from the Citadel and spread across Terrea, living among the Gauld.","Rulik grew wary of Primus and their Primordials, and began to worry that the Gauld would all willingly become Primordials. So Rulik decided to gift the knowledge of controlling aether energy directly to the Gauld. The aether energy that the Gauld controls manifests itselg as a Specter, and is a representation of the user's willpower and spirit. A Specter gave the user supernatural powers that are unique to the user. Rulik believed that the Specters would allow the Gauld to withstand against any force, primordial or otherwise.","The discovery of Specters led to the formalisation of its use, and academies dedicatd to teaching how to harness your Specter formed across the Terrea. However this led to tensions inside Gauld society, and conflicts arose about how to use the aether. Tensions were rapidly rising, which led to the Great War"]},R={id:"sundering",name:"The Sundering",paragraphs:["Primus finally achieved creation without solely relying on the aether after the birth of the Primordial race with the help of the Primordialists. The Gauld took notes from this event and used it to drive their knowledge about creating fantastical devices powered by Primoridal shards, to the point that the Gauld essentially met or surpassed modern technology feats (they don't need electronics and computers when they have 'magic' power). So the Gauld were already on their way to achieving new heights, and Primus already felt left behind.","Primus wanted everything, and to this end he believed there was only one solution; Godhood. But they could not achieve this alone, and so Primus secretly sought help from allies among the Gauld. This was kept hidden, because there was already tensions (and sometimes outright violence) between Gauld factions. Primus headed a massive world-wide conspiracy with one goal; how to turn someone into a God.","But the conspiracy was eventually discovered, and the Gods immediately went on the offensive. But Primus was not alone this time, as their Gauld allies had created terrible and awe-inspiring machines that allowed them to hold their own against the Gods. The battles raged across the world, and it became an arms race between the two sides. Artra and Baltha created increasingly deadly monsters and devastating plagues to ravage the Gauld and PrimordialS, while the mortals invented new devices and weapons of war to keep up.","Only Rulik abstained from the fighting, horrified at what has befallen to Terrea. Rulik only decided to act near the end, when Artra and Baltha created a disease that sterilized it's host instead of killing them, allowing the invisible disease to spread and infect the whole mortal population before being detected. As a retaliation, the mortals sought to tear the realms apart in a dying bid to get even with the Gods. Rulik could stand aside no longer, and he sought an audience with Primus.","Rulik offered to delicately sunder the Mid-Realm into two distinct pieces, and offer ownership of one half as a sanctuary for the Primus and their allies. Mid-Realm would remain, but it will have a twin that follows in it's shadow. And, more importantly, it would be kept away from the clutches of Artra and Baltha. Primus reluctantly agreed; it was not complete Godhood, but it was an existence. The other Gods were infuriated at first when they learned of Rulik's deal, but relented when they learned that the Sundering would strip some of the potency in primoridal magics to create the new realm, ensuring that mortals would never again achieve the feats of the Gauld.","When the Sundering was complete, the Primus traded his connection to the aether for direct control of the new Shadowrealm. He named it Sanctuary, and his allies began to pass into Sanctuary. The passage left behind more than just their bodies, and they became the Spirits, Daemons and Shadows of the Shadowrealm. They remember only a part of what they used to be, and no longer concerned themselves about matters of the flesh. All except the Primus, who since their birth was spited by the Gods. He secretly kept a private oath that they would all return, and that Primus would take the Godhood that they believe was rightly theirs.","Some of the Gauld stayed behind, even though they were sterilized and doomed as a race. They were mainly the Specters, who saw the Gauld who followed Primus as foolish and wanted to pass into the nether as normal. These Gauld worked tirelessly to ensure that a part of Gauld culture survived in Terrea, and to maybe pass on the secrets of Specters to a worthy
