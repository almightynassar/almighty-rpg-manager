They quickly defeated all enemies and interrogate the survivors, learning about the Collector's interest in Mandevrath.\n\n## Session 2: Droids\n\nThe party found themselves stuck in a room that eventually turned out to be a contamination cleansing process. They also discovered a few Droids which Raorik took an interest in.\n\n## Session 3: The Collectors\n\nThe Collectors finally arrived at Mandevrath, and bargained with the party for ownership of the facility. This resulted in battle, where the party barely won. The party entered the final room, discovering a special type of spider that could phase through walls.\n\n## Session 4: Mystery at Mandevrath\n\nRaorik, Bendris and Geliah ventured deep into Mandevrath to find out secrets within. There were strange happenings within the walls of the underground where it appeared to be a laboratory. Further investigations lead the group to discover an ancient base to find a way to battle the Dragon threat. The denizens of Mandevrath developed biological warfare to stem the tide of the Dragon forces. In doing so they developed various Dragon-themed weaponry and found ways to bend space and time in secret rooms to further their reach. The group found the last door holding something within and stand ready venture forth.\n\n## Session 5: Kruxas & Handeep\n\nHaving ascertained the murky nature of the tragedy that had befallen the researchers of Mandevrath, the party proceeded into the two-keycard sealed vault (that had been hereto unopened for potentially hundreds of years). As soon as the doors opened, they were presented with what appeared to be an attempted jailbreak - Kobolds had been enslaved by Vampire Kobolds (who were overseen by the three remaining surviving researchers who had become Vampires of their own). At that moment, only one Head Vampire was present alongside a handful of VK who were attempting to restrain and even kill the escaping Kobolds. The party leapt into action, and after a very nearly deadly battle, successfully killed the Head Vampire (who was identified as Kruxas) and the VK. They then freed the caged Kobolds, as well as a curiously Undead Spectral (whose powers were manifested through sheer will of vengeance), then set about planning for an expedition into the now-uncovered Kobold caves to free the remaining Kobolds (which potentially means slaying the Vampires).\n\n## Session 6: Moixa and the Kobold Town\n\nThe party entered Koburg, the Kobold town underneath Mandevrath. They tried to stealthily enter, but instead started a kobold insurrection against their vampire masters. The vampires were eventually overwhelmed by the combined might of the party and the kobolds, and Moixa tried to use her shapeshifting ability to escape. The party saw through the ruse, and gave Handeep the revenge he craved for so long.\n\n---\n\n# Intermission\n\n## Session 7: Into the Aetherdeck\n\nBendris, and his Kobold sidekick Bamo, went into the Aetherdeck to explore one of the artificial realities (code: 3-2-3). They were immediately greeted by a quaint village, and an argument between the village elder and a nobleman. They also met Ulrich Von Liectenstein, who constantly mentioned that they were a true and proper knight. They discovered that there were weird happenings in the village, where the miners were compelled to work or suffered spontaneous head combustion. Bendris, Bamo, and Ulrich visited the mine where they met a cultist priest. The Cultist priest showed the trio a portal that opened to a realm inhabited by an Eldritch being. The Eldritch demanded that the trio submit to it, but Bendris and Bamo were pulled out of the Aetherdeck, just in time....\n\n---\n\n# Leadengold Arc\n\n## Session 8: On the road again\n\nGeliah had a breakthrough with the party, detailing his past with the shadowy Hentergrey special forces unit called the Blood Fangs. Perron and his deserters used to work with the Blood Fangs and let the party know that the Blood Fangs were tasked with creating Specters as weapons for the Empire. The party came across the town of Leadengold, which Bendris recognised as being similar to the town he encountered in the Aetherdeck. This led the party to the mines, where they discovered the dead body of a Blood Fang and a thinning between the veils of the realms. They also had the surprise of Ulrich entering their realm using a special spear.\n\n## Session 9: La Orida Mesigisto\n\nUlrich was cagey and distrustful of the party, which led the party to corner Ulrich and force the otherworldy knight to use their spear to escape to potentially another realm and be a problem there. Upon leaving the cave, they encountered the Blood Fang Sahntah, a Specter user that could create ice around them and had some mild charm abilities. Before the party could defeat Sahntah, an adult dragon landed and claimed the Blood Fang as their own. Through some questioning the party learned that Raorik was known to the dragons as \"La Orida Mesagisto\", or the Little Golden Messanger. Raorik's job was to broker a peace between the Gauld and the Dragons.\n\n## Session 10: The Man in Armour\n\nThe party were on the road, and on the way they met an group fleeing from a large man in a suit of armour. The man in armour claimed that the group had kidnapped their brother, and was on a bloody rampage. The party joined the man in armour, and discovered they were fighting against the Special Research Division (or S.R.D). During the pitched battle, the camp leader noticed Geliah using his spectral abilities and ordered his men to try to capture him (along with the armoured man). But the camp was ultimately defeated, and then the armoured man indicated that he thought his brother was being held behind a massive door carved into the side of the mountain.\n\n## Session 11: Inquisitor Krieg\n\nThe party entered the mountain cave, and discovered Krieg and his macabre work. It turns out that Mark was actually a Specter placed into a mechanical body, and his \"brother\" was a Spectral user named Reinhardt. The Inquisitor was in the process of transferring more Specters into mechanical bodies, using the bodies left behind as collatoral to keep the Spectral spirits in line. The party battled Krieg and his machines, unfortunately killing two before figuring out how to save the Specters and the remaining 5 linked users. They also saved Krist and Reinhardt before Krieg initiated the self-destruct mechanism of his lab and warning the rest of the S.R.D in Dessingrove.\n\n---\n\n# Dessingrove arc\n\n## Session 12: Magistrate Mofkeen\n\nA month has passed since the party first arrived at Mandevrath, and there was some reflection as some of their friends parted ways to take care of the survivors of Krieg's experiments (promising to stay in touch using GauldMail). Perrone stayed on to keep his promise of guiding the party to the Collectors in Dessingrove. Raorik conversed with Reinhardt about the nature of Specters while reading the manuals for his droids, Bendris plied the prisoner Krieg for information about the SRD (and earned the former Inspector's professional respect), Sigmane managed to decode Sahntah's message, and Geliah dreamed of getting bigger and better weapons.\n\nHowever, on arrival to Dessingrove the party discovered that a small Hentergrey army was camped nearby. The camp has been set up during the week, putting the city of Dessingrove on edge. The party managed to get inside the city walls with Krieg still in custody, convincing the former Inspector that it was better to stay with the party than be turned over to the Partisans. Inside the city, the party experienced the electrifying effects of the Magistrate's speech and the range of emotions they evoked.\n\n## Session 13: Spectrum of the Collectors\n\nThe group parted ways, with some exploring the Merchant Quarter of Dessingrove and the rest drinking it up in the tavern. Bendris found the Ersomheaf Tech Pty Ltd and struck a deal, while Raorik notes that the company may have some AI/MI experience. The rest of the party enjoyed many drinks at the tavern where they met Lippus Heints Godoosebrt, a Lefantian mercenary.\n\nEventually Perrone led the party to the Collectors headquarters, an unassuming building located at the crossroads of the Lordes, Westgate and Merchant Quarter districts. The building does have an extensive underground network, which Perrone led the party through, and there were many facilities dedicated to tech research, including a device called the Replicator. The Collectors all wore lab white uniforms. Perrone left the party in a large meeting hall, leaving to go join his mercenary band. Sigmane led Krieg away to the Collectors dungeons. Bamo stayed with the party. PT-117 is recording the meeting. I am assuming J4R-J4R and C3P-D0H are watching the wagon.\n\nThe large hall held the regional leader of the Collectors, a Lefantian names Jerts Dina. Jerts is aided by a bronze Forged named Seidel Iteration 3, and there is also the Collector's Public Liason Chu'si Nateri, a Teztec woman. And there was Spectrum, the worldwide leader of the Collectors.\n\nSpectrum revealed some of Raorik's past, including the plans of Sesom. Sesom was one of the few Gauld left behind, who created the Elderforged and was based in Phalanxis. Spectrum expressed regret at some of the decisions made at the time, including putting Raorik into hibernation.\n\nThen there was suddenly an explosion as the Collector's base is now under attack.\n\n## Session 14: The Younglings\n\nThe Collector's base was attacked by members of the SRD, and it was later learned that the attackers helped Krieg out of prison. Siedel quickly hired the group for a secret task, which was to save 4 young spectral users. One of these users was a Gauld child named Claudine.\n\nDuring the escape, Sigmane opted for a kamikaze run to stop the SRD from attacking the party with rockets. However, the party was able to give enough assistance that Sigmane was able to survive, although trapped on the other side of a collapse corridoor.\n\nThe party was able to secure an exit from the Collector's base, and were able to learn that the attack was actually undertaken by disguised members of the Blood Fangs.\n\n## Session 15: Beriah Inc.\n\nThe party escaped the Collector's base, and took the young children to the Collector's hideout in the docks distrinct. The hideout was an office space for Teztec Shell Co. Geliah was able to secure disguises for the children, while Bendris used his tech-smarts to sneak their way to the base. Raorik visited Ersomheaf and met Grailest, a researcher who could help Raorik in his quest to give machines a soul.\n\nSiedel paid out part of the parties cheque, and added 10,000 cp reward from his own savings as payment for keeping the children safe. The payment is also meant to purchase the group's silence and secrecy in regards to the younglings. This payment was paid out to the newly formed Beriah Inc, a newly formed adventuring company.\n\n---\n\n# Krieg arc\n\n## Session 16: On the hunt for Krieg\n\nAfter a day resting in the warehouse, the calm was interrupted by a dozen Collector's carrying in a malfunctioning Spectrum. The droid leader had damaged their memory by operating in an unsafe manner to protect his fellow Collectors. A brief moment of lucidity allowed Spectrum to warn Raorik not to trust Sesom, the former Gauldian boss of the two forged over 500 years ago (Raorik was a diplomat, and Spectrum worked in Security).\n\nSeidel and Jerts reunited, and planned with Inspector-General Basmus Staartij (Lefantian male, Dessingrove Police) and Detective Xingbo Rengling (Locanth male) about recapturing Krieg. Basmus and Xingbo recruit the party to carry out the investigation for them, and gave the party an official Dessingrove warrant.\n\nThe start of the investigation took the party to Siliano's Tavern in the Beggars Bit, where the party met a goblin representative of the Thieve's Guild named simply Johto. There was a trade in secrets, where the party told Johto a little bit about their adventures while Johto told the party that if he was going to smuggle something into the city, he would do it via the docks. Also, a local tailor supplied the Blood Fang disguises.\n\nThe next step was to the West Gate guard tower, where they met Sargeant Lucchio Giandrazio. The overworked man was extremely co-operative, and supplied information that matched up with what Johto said. The third stop was to the tailor, a sweet old woman who again corroborated the other statements.\n\nThe party then confronted the Harbour Master, a Merfolk bureaucrat name Norochi Kento. Norochi admitted that the security of the docks was lacklustre to encourage more free trade, and that he hired out the warehouses to practically anyone who could pay. The party was able to get information about the potential Blood Fang hideout, and left to investigate. While conducting a stakeout they saw the red-headed, bearded man that the tailor described as buying the uniforms.\n\nThe party had found out where the Blood Fangs were hiding out....\n\n## Session 17: A Tale of Two Kriegs\n\nThe party left Lippus behind while they reported their findings. Inspector-General Basmus ordered the warehouse to be surrounded, but Detective Xingbo had ideas to stealthily enter the warehouse through the sewers. The party countered all the traps they managed to find, climbing up to see a Blood Fang commander having an argument with a robotic version of Krieg. The argument became heated, until another Krieg robot uncloaked and murdered the Blood Fang commander.\n\nThe party revealed themselves, fighting and defeating the two Krieg robots.\n\n## Session 18: An unexpected visit\n\nUnderneath the warehouse the party found Cavill Henryson, a captive dwarf that was tasked with making components for the Blood Fangs. The party freed Cavill and discovered that he had apprentice named Gorog that was captured by the Blood Fangs as well. Gorog was sickly, and Cavill believes that his apprenticed may have been turned into a Kriegbot.\n\nDuring a quick investigation of the warehouse, Geliah found an encrypted letter while Bendris discovered a working pair of Aether-goggles. A goblin sidled up to Geliah and handed over a written request to meet Johto, the leader of the Thieves Guild in Dessingrove. Geliah, Bendris and Cavill made their way to Siliano's Tavern and had a few drinks while they waited for the meeting.\n\nEventually Johto summoned the party to an upstairs room, where the party were confronted by the vampire, Vivirane. The vampire seemed to have something over Johto, as the Goblinoid mobster is cowed in her presence. Vivirane revealed that she works for Malfium, the vampire that caused so much trouble in Mandevrath and is now the leader of the Blood Fangs. She also coyly revealed that the Blood Fangs had Rivergrip in custody, Geliah's childhood friend and army buddy, as well as Gorog the apprentice.\n\nVivirane demands that the party find Krieg (alive!) or his bots (Cavill suggested there could be up to 12 out there), and gave the party of list of 3 locations where the eccentric artificer could be hiding. She offered that the hostages will be released safely if the party could follow through. The party offered a single Kriegbot head in return for at least some proof that the hostages are still alive. Vivirane agreed and promptly left.\n\nAfter the meeting, Johto silently motioned for the party to stick around. His goons quickly surveiled the room to make sure Vivirane wasn't hiding, and then revealed that he doesn't like being forced into service with the Blood Fangs. Johto proposed a plan to ambush Vivirane during the handover of Krieg and potentially kill her and maybe her boss, Malfium.",i={name:"Sessions",data:function(){return{markdown:o}}},h=i,s=a("2877"),d=Object(s["a"])(h,n,r,!1,null,null,null);t["default"]=d.exports}}]);
