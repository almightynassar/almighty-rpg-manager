They were used by the Gauld for menial labour, and many continue to serve a similar purpose today. The techniques used to create new Droids have been lost, so most Droids are heavily maintained pieces of machinery.\r\n\r\n- **C3P-D0H:** An alcohol distillery robot. Knows 6 millions forms of distillation.\r\n- **J4R-J4R:** Created as a child's mascot, but proved to be largely unpopular.\r\n\r\n## PT-117\r\n\r\nProfessor Tablet 117 is the size of piece of paper and is as thick as a book. This droid is powered by an Aether Shard, and contains a colour screen, speakers, microphone, and camera. It's stats are 18 INT, 10 WIS, 7 CHA. It speaks and understands Gauldish, Draconic, and Common. It can be programmed with up to 3 additional languages by undergoing a training process.\r\n\r\nPT-117 has hearing and sight of up to 18m, and has no will of it's own. Knows extensive information about Dragons, Vampires, Virology, and the Aetherdeck. This means it gets a +9 bonus to areas of it's expertise. PT-117 has a limited form of movement via in-built hoverjets.\r\n\r\nPT-177 also has an extensive analysis of the ritualistic murder scene that occurred in the mines of Leadengold (where Ulrich first broke through between the realms). This can be used to gain advantage on rolls used to investigate the Blood Fang ritual.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n# Dessingrove, Orland\r\n\r\n## Deserters (501st)\r\n\r\nThese Deserters were formerly part of the Hentergrey 501st Company. They are all human, and come from the city of Walla, far to the east on the north-western shores of the World Center. They worked as guards and jailors for the Blood Fangs, a mysterious special forces unit that allegedly creates Spectres for the Hentergrey army.\r\n\r\n- **Perron Sebasté:** Leader of the band.\r\n- **Cléon Evand:** A scout, hunter and naturalist, has a keen interest in learning about the world around them.\r\n- **Haman Ulin:** Loves to fight, and it’s up to their opponents whether it’s via hands or wit.\r\n- **Bastin Golorbas:** The chef of the band, and an avid musician and dancer.\r\n- **Galeb Erren:** Has the brains for all things technical, but didn’t have the money for an education.\r\n\r\n## Reinhardt\r\n\r\nAdventurer and Mercenary, taken by the SRD and experimented on. Mark I is his specter, and was ripped from Reinhardt by Inspector Krieg of the SRD. Reinhardt tries to spend time away from major cities and hubs of civilization, knowing that his Specter abilities can often make him a target of the Empire.\r\n\r\nHe is currently staying with Krist on the outskirts of Dessingrove.\r\n\r\n## Krist \r\n\r\nA healer prized for her knowledge and abilities (which are generally reserved for emergency situations). She lives on the outskirts of Dessingrove with Reinhardt and the other survivors of Krieg's experiments.\r\n\r\n## Ersomheaf Tech Pty Ltd.\r\n\r\nA family run Dwarven congolomerate located in the Merchant Quarter of Dessingrove with some excellent quality wares. The family members are:\r\n\r\n- Master Artificer Grailer Ersomheaf, a red-headed pale dwarf that looks like the dwarf equivalent of an IT professional\r\n- Master Blacksmith Grai Ersomheaf, a black-headed, muscular and tanned dwarf\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n# Hentergrey Empire\r\n\r\n## Magistrate Wilhum Mofkeen\r\n\r\nMagistrate Mofkeen is mandated by the Emperor to bring the rebellious elements of the empire back into the fold. The Magistrate made this speech in an attempt to convince the citizens of Dessingrove to reject the Partisan cause and peacefully join the Empire. He is a tall, thin and gaunt human male with wispy grey hair and sunken eyes that burst with intelligence.\r\n\r\n## General Marget Bourdeau, 5th Eagle Army\r\n\r\nThe general leads the 5th Eagle Army, currently assigned to protect Magistrate Mofkeen in Orland. She is a short and stocky human woman with short, blood-red locks and a piercing gaze. She is known to be a expert marksman.\r\n\r\nThe 5th Eagle Army contains the 501st Company, the former unit of Perrone Sabaste and his gang.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n# Blood Fangs\r\n\r\nThe Blood Fangs are a special forces group within the Hentergrey army. They are rumoured to include many Spectre specialists, and are sent deep into enemy territory to perform deniable operations.\r\n\r\n## Dr Drafus Malfium \r\n\r\nA DNA specialist for the MST (Mandevrath Science Team). Was seen as the purest form of evil in the Kobold pantheon in Koburg. Currently a General in the Hentergrey army, leading the Blood Fangs in the drive to bring the Gauld back into Midrealm.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n# S.R.D (Special Research Division)\r\n\r\nThe S.R.D. are a special quasi-military group of the Hentergrey Empire, who have been tasked with acquiring and using ancient Gauldian tech for the benifit of the Empire. They are known by various different names based on the \"S\" (such as the Spectre Research Division), and a popular rumour within the Hentergrey military is because the division bought the embrodiered uniforms before settling on a name. The S.R.D is often in direct competition with the Bloodfangs for both resources and favour from the Emperor.\r\n\r\nAs with many tech hunters they are often found investigating ruins and are surprising adept at using Gauldian tech for combat purposes.\r\n\r\n## Inquisitor Krieg\r\n\r\nA member of the S.R.D’s Dessingrove group, and a proficient user of Gauldian combat technology. Krieg had discovered a Gauldian consciousness transfer unit, originally used on the Forged to transfer a consciousness from one body to the next. With some minor experimentation and tweaks, Krieg managed to separate the Specter from their user and trap it in a mechanical body. Supposedly this was to create obedient, unstoppable soldiers for the Hentigrey Army. The first successful transfer was Mark I, however the Specter retained their free will and broke free. The following Mark II units required a link to the Specter's original body to be controlled properly. If the Specter's mechanical body was destroyed without being physically linked back to their original body, both the Specter and the User would die.\r\n\r\n## Grand Inquisitor Petrus\r\n\r\nPotentially has a close connection to the Emperor, and could be in Dessingrove. They are usually based in Hirst, the capital of the Hentergrey Empire. Not much is known except that they have a high interest in the discovery of new Gauldian Technology.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n# Collectors\r\n\r\nCollectors aim to contain and preserve Gauldian technology, believing that it is dangerous in the wrong hands and that it caused the banishment of the Gauld to the Shadowrealm. By regulating and restricting access to Gauldian technology, the Collectors believe that the modern races can avoid a similar fate.\r\n\r\n## Mandevrath Chapter\r\n\r\nThese Collectors were sent to Mandevrath to acertain whether it's secrets will be helpful to the Collector cause. The team includes two human Spectres (**Avervand** & **Pastance**), a Lacinum diplomat (**Nabur**), and two Orc guards (**Oska** & **Torge**).\r\n\r\n## Dessingrove Chapter\r\n\r\nThe leader is the Lefantian Jerts Dina, a short fellow with sunken eyes and tattered ears. The public liason is the Teztec Chu'si Nateri, who has spottled emerald green skin and she is missing part of her left thumb. Jerts is ably assisted by the Forged Seidel Iteration 3, who has a bronze-coloured chassis that is engraved with decorative patterns.\r\n\r\n### Spectrum\r\n\r\nSpectrum is the leader of the Collectors, and is visiting Dessingrove on a '*Pilgrammage*'. His chassis is a sheeming coat of chrome, but with the obvious sign of wear and tear from centuries of use. His eyes burn bright, and he is constantly looking around his environment as if he is assessing each and every thing.\r\n\r\nHe has chosen to retain all of his memories instead of doing a fresh restart. This makes him seem to act slower and more lethargic than others of his kind, as his RAM and SWAP spaces are at full capacity and his memory subroutines are constantly trying to optimise his memory. To help the optimisation, he only speaks in Gauldian as most of his primary memories are in this ancient language.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n# Kobolds of Koburg\r\n\r\nThe Kobolds are the half-dragon, half-gauld creations of the Mandevrath Science Team. They were subjected to experimentations that tested dragon-killing weapons.\r\n\r\nThe only Kobold city in all of Terrea is hidden underground, underneath the Gauldian ruins of Mandevrath. The elder Kobold who effectively runs the city is **Mudran**, uncle of the parties’ Kobold **Bamo**. Koburg is now effectively under the protection of the Collectors, who conduct their research on the secrets of Mandevrath and the Aetherdeck.\r\n\r\nKobolds saved from Kruxas were Mudran (leader), Praba, Vinda, and Bamo.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n# Dragons\r\n\r\n## Shanaphuin\r\n\r\nThis red-coloured dragon took Sahntah away from the party outside Leadengold, looking for Mandevrath. The dragon did tell Raorik that he used to serve the Gauld as a peace emmissary.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n# Legends\r\n\r\n## Sesom\r\n\r\nOne of the Gauld who chose to not remain behind when the rest went into the Shadowrealm. He was based in Phalanxis and was crucial in the creation of the elderforged, and ensured that Gauldian culture lived on long past his death.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n# Missing\r\n\r\n## Ulrich Von Lichtenstien\r\n\r\nA Human Knight from another reality, with a spear that can transport the user to another realm.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n# Dead\r\n\r\n## Handeep\r\n\r\nHandeep was an undead Kobold that channelled their Specter essence of a Specter to effectively make them immortal. Handeep thirsts for revenge and retribution against the Vampires was eventually quenched with the death of Moixa. Handeep passed into the Nether when he killed Moixa.\r\n\r\n## Mandevrath Science Team\r\n\r\nThe MST were killed by the vampire Drafus Malfium.\r\n\r\n- Dr Vardus Sonorius (Project Lead). Assumed dead from Vampire attack. Creator of the Aetherdeck. Was seen as the father of the Kobold pantheon.\r\n- Chief Alexandros Maxim (Security). Died from Vampire attack. Was seen as a War god in the Kobold pantheon.\r\n- Dr Tullas Kobo (Geneticist). Assumed dead from Vampire attack. Creator of the Kobolds.
