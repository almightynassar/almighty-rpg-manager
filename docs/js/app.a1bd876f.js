strict";i.r(t);var a=" ### Warrior Culture\r\n \r\n Orcish culture revers battle and strength, and see not being able to protect what you own is a unforgivable weakness. Orc warriors are not any more bloodthirsty than the other races, but their penchant for raiding and plunder means that they are painted as bloodthirsty barbarians.\r\n \r\n ### Tribal Culture\r\n \r\n Orcish generally live in familial tribes that constantly migrate, following where there is plentiful food and plunder. The only settlement the Orcs acknowledge is goblinoid city of Angarth, where the orcish tribes will travel too every year and participate in the Moot. All inter-clan disputes are settled and voted on (or, more commonly, by arena combat).\r\n \r\n ### Friends of Goblins\r\n \r\n The Orcs share the Shattered Isles with the goblinoid races.

They are large-to-gigantic flying reptilian mammals that can breathe out various elemental energies, and are very difficult to kill. They are also extremely cunning and intelligent.

They loathe to share with others.\r\n- **Curious:** They have an innate wanderlust and a thirst for knowledge.\r\n- **Long Memories:** A dragon has a generational memory, and will generally remember the character of groups of mortals rather than individuals. They also never forget slights or threats.\r\n- **Elemental Breath:** Dragons have a natural breath weapon that deals elemental damage. The breath weapon that a dragon uses is partly inherited, partly environmental. The colour of a dragon does not factor into the breath type.\r\n- **Gerontocracy:** Ruled by the eldest dragons in the local tribe or faction. There is no centralised authority when it comes to Dragons, as they are always fighting with each other.\r\n\r\n## Wyverns\r\n\r\nWyverns are simply the runts of a Dragon’s litter. A female Dragon can birth one full sized dragon and a litter of roughly a dozen Wyverns. A female Wyvern can birth two or three.\r\nWyverns are less intelligent and more bestial than their larger brethren, and can still understand  and speak some Draconic.
