They quickly defeated all enemies and interrogate the survivors, learning about the Collector's interest in Mandevrath.\r\n\r\n## Session 2: Droids\r\n\r\nThe party found themselves stuck in a room that eventually turned out to be a contamination cleansing process. They also discovered a few Droids which Raorik took an interest in.\r\n\r\n## Session 3: The Collectors\r\n\r\nThe Collectors finally arrived at Mandevrath, and bargained with the party for ownership of the facility. This resulted in battle, where the party barely won. The party entered the final room, discovering a special type of spider that could phase through walls.\r\n\r\n## Session 4: Mystery at Mandevrath\r\n\r\nRaorik, Bendris and Geliah ventured deep into Mandevrath to find out secrets within. There were strange happenings within the walls of the underground where it appeared to be a laboratory. Further investigations lead the group to discover an ancient base to find a way to battle the Dragon threat. The denizens of Mandevrath developed biological warfare to stem the tide of the Dragon forces. In doing so they developed various Dragon-themed weaponry and found ways to bend space and time in secret rooms to further their reach. The group found the last door holding something within and stand ready venture forth.\r\n\r\n## Session 5: Kruxas & Handeep\r\n\r\nHaving ascertained the murky nature of the tragedy that had befallen the researchers of Mandevrath, the party proceeded into the two-keycard sealed vault (that had been hereto unopened for potentially hundreds of years). As soon as the doors opened, they were presented with what appeared to be an attempted jailbreak - Kobolds had been enslaved by Vampire Kobolds (who were overseen by the three remaining surviving researchers who had become Vampires of their own). At that moment, only one Head Vampire was present alongside a handful of VK who were attempting to restrain and even kill the escaping Kobolds. The party leapt into action, and after a very nearly deadly battle, successfully killed the Head Vampire (who was identified as Kruxas) and the VK. They then freed the caged Kobolds, as well as a curiously Undead Spectral (whose powers were manifested through sheer will of vengeance), then set about planning for an expedition into the now-uncovered Kobold caves to free the remaining Kobolds (which potentially means slaying the Vampires).\r\n\r\n## Session 6: Moixa and the Kobold Town\r\n\r\nThe party entered Koburg, the Kobold town underneath Mandevrath. They tried to stealthily enter, but instead started a kobold insurrection against their vampire masters. The vampires were eventually overwhelmed by the combined might of the party and the kobolds, and Moixa tried to use her shapeshifting ability to escape. The party saw through the ruse, and gave Handeep the revenge he craved for so long.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n# Intermission\r\n\r\n## Session 7: Into the Aetherdeck\r\n\r\nBendris, and his Kobold sidekick Bamo, went into the Aetherdeck to explore one of the artificial realities (code: 3-2-3). They were immediately greeted by a quaint village, and an argument between the village elder and a nobleman. They also met Ulrich Von Liectenstein, who constantly mentioned that they were a true and proper knight. They discovered that there were weird happenings in the village, where the miners were compelled to work or suffered spontaneous head combustion. Bendris, Bamo, and Ulrich visited the mine where they met a cultist priest. The Cultist priest showed the trio a portal that opened to a realm inhabited by an Eldritch being. The Eldritch demanded that the trio submit to it, but Bendris and Bamo were pulled out of the Aetherdeck, just in time....\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n# Leadengold Arc\r\n\r\n## Session 8: On the road again\r\n\r\nGeliah had a breakthrough with the party, detailing his past with the shadowy Hentergrey special forces unit called the Blood Fangs. Perron and his deserters used to work with the Blood Fangs and let the party know that the Blood Fangs were tasked with creating Specters as weapons for the Empire. The party came across the town of Leadengold, which Bendris recognised as being similar to the town he encountered in the Aetherdeck. This led the party to the mines, where they discovered the dead body of a Blood Fang and a thinning between the veils of the realms. They also had the surprise of Ulrich entering their realm using a special spear.\r\n\r\n## Session 9: La Orida Mesigisto\r\n\r\nUlrich was cagey and distrustful of the party, which led the party to corner Ulrich and force the otherworldy knight to use their spear to escape to potentially another realm and be a problem there. Upon leaving the cave, they encountered the Blood Fang Sahntah, a Specter user that could create ice around them and had some mild charm abilities. Before the party could defeat Sahntah, an adult dragon landed and claimed the Blood Fang as their own. Through some questioning the party learned that Raorik was known to the dragons as \"La Orida Mesagisto\", or the Little Golden Messanger. Raorik's job was to broker a peace between the Gauld and the Dragons.\r\n\r\n## Session 10: The Man in Armour\r\n\r\nThe party were on the road, and on the way they met an group fleeing from a large man in a suit of armour. The man in armour claimed that the group had kidnapped their brother, and was on a bloody rampage. The party joined the man in armour, and discovered they were fighting against the Special Research Division (or S.R.D). During the pitched battle, the camp leader noticed Geliah using his spectral abilities and ordered his men to try to capture him (along with the armoured man). But the camp was ultimately defeated, and then the armoured man indicated that he thought his brother was being held behind a massive door carved into the side of the mountain.\r\n\r\n## Session 11: Inquisitor Krieg\r\n\r\nThe party entered the mountain cave, and discovered Krieg and his macabre work. It turns out that Mark was actually a Specter placed into a mechanical body, and his \"brother\" was a Spectral user named Reinhardt. The Inquisitor was in the process of transferring more Specters into mechanical bodies, using the bodies left behind as collatoral to keep the Spectral spirits in line. The party battled Krieg and his machines, unfortunately killing two before figuring out how to save the Specters and the remaining 5 linked users. They also saved Krist and Reinhardt before Krieg initiated the self-destruct mechanism of his lab and warning the rest of the S.R.D in Dessingrove.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n# Dessingrove arc\r\n\r\n## Session 12: Magistrate Mofkeen\r\n\r\nA month has passed since the party first arrived at Mandevrath, and there was some reflection as some of their friends parted ways to take care of the survivors of Krieg's experiments (promising to stay in touch using GauldMail). Perrone stayed on to keep his promise of guiding the party to the Collectors in Dessingrove. Raorik conversed with Reinhardt about the nature of Specters while reading the manuals for his droids, Bendris plied the prisoner Krieg for information about the SRD (and earned the former Inspector's professional respect), Sigmane managed to decode Sahntah's message, and Geliah dreamed of getting bigger and better weapons.\r\n\r\nHowever, on arrival to Dessingrove the party discovered that a small Hentergrey army was camped nearby. The camp has been set up during the week, putting the city of Dessingrove on edge. The party managed to get inside the city walls with Krieg still in custody, convincing the former Inspector that it was better to stay with the party than be turned over to the Partisans. Inside the city, the party experienced the electrifying effects of the Magistrate's speech and the range of emotions they evoked.\r\n\r\n## Session 13: Spectrum of the Collectors\r\n\r\nThe group parted ways, with some exploring the Merchant Quarter of Dessingrove and the rest drinking it up in the tavern. Bendris found the Ersomheaf Tech Pty Ltd and struck a deal, while Raorik notes that the company may have some AI/MI experience. The rest of the party enjoyed many drinks at the tavern where they met Lippus Heints Godoosebrt, a Lefantian mercenary.\r\n\r\nEventually Perrone led the party to the Collectors headquarters, an unassuming building located at the crossroads of the Lordes, Westgate and Merchant Quarter districts. The building does have an extensive underground network, which Perrone led the party through, and there were many facilities dedicated to tech research, including a device called the Replicator. The Collectors all wore lab white uniforms. Perrone left the party in a large meeting hall, leaving to go join his mercenary band. Sigmane led Krieg away to the Collectors dungeons. Bamo stayed with the party. PT-117 is recording the meeting. I am assuming J4R-J4R and C3P-D0H are watching the wagon.\r\n\r\nThe large hall held the regional leader of the Collectors, a Lefantian names Jerts Dina. Jerts is aided by a bronze Forged named Seidel Iteration 3, and there is also the Collector's Public Liason Chu'si Nateri, a Teztec woman. And there was Spectrum, the worldwide leader of the Collectors.\r\n\r\nSpectrum revealed some of Raorik's past, including the plans of Sesom. Sesom was one of the few Gauld left behind, who created the Elderforged and was based in Phalanxis. Spectrum expressed regret at some of the decisions made at the time, including putting Raorik into hibernation.\r\n\r\nThen there was suddenly an explosion as the Collector's base is now under attack.\r\n",i={name:"Sessions",data:function(){return{markdown:o}}},s=i,h=a("2877"),d=Object(h["a"])(s,r,n,!1,null,null,null);t["default"]=d.exports}}]);
