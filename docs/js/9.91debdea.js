The team includes two human Spectres (Avervand & Pastance), a Lacinum diplomat (Nabur), and two Orc guards (Oska & Torge).\r\n\r\n## Droids\r\n\r\nDroids have limited AI, and are not sentient like the Forged. They were used by the Gauld for menial labour, and many continue to serve a similar purpose today. The techniques used to create new Droids have been lost, so most Droids are heavily maintained pieces of machinery.\r\n\r\n- **C3P-D0H:** An alcohol distillery robot. Knows 6 millions forms of distillation.\r\n- **J4R-J4R:** Created as a child's mascot, but proved to be largely unpopular.\r\n\r\n## PT-117\r\n\r\nProfessor Tablet 117 is the size of piece of paper and is as thick as a book. This droid is powered by an Aether Shard, and contains a colour screen, speakers, microphone, and camera. It's stats are 18 INT, 10 WIS, 7 CHA. It speaks and understands Gauldish, Draconic, and Common. It can be programmed with up to 3 additional languages by undergoing a training process.\r\n\r\nPT-117 has hearing and sight of up to 18m, and has no will of it's own. Knows extensive information about Dragons, Vampires, Virology, and the Aetherdeck. This means it gets a +9 bonus to areas of it's expertise. PT-117 has a limited form of movement via in-built hoverjets.\r\n\r\n## Hentergrey Deserters (501st)\r\n\r\nThese Deserters were formally part of the Hentergrey 501st legion. The leader of the band is Perron Sebasté. The others are Cléon Evand, Haman Ulin, Bastin Golorbas, and Galeb Erren. They are all human.\r\n\r\n## Kobolds\r\n\r\nThe Kobolds are the half-dragon, half-gauld creations of the Mandevrath Science Team. They were subjected to experimentations that tested dragon-killing weapons.\r\n\r\nKobolds saved from Kruxas were Mudran (leader), Praba, Vinda, and Bamo.\r\n\r\n## Dr Drafus Malfium \r\n\r\nA DNA specialist for the MST (Mandevrath Science Team). Actually a vampire, and is currently at large. Was seen as the purest form of evil in the Kobold pantheon.\r\n\r\n# Dead\r\n\r\n## Handeep\r\n\r\nHandeep was an undead Kobold that channelled their Specter essence of a Specter to effectively make them immortal. Handeep thirsts for revenge and retribution against the Vampires was eventually quenched with the death of Moixa. Handeep passed into the Nether when he killed Moixa.\r\n\r\n## Mandevrath Science Team\r\n\r\nThe MST were killed by the vampire Drafus Malfium.\r\n\r\n- Dr Vardus Sonorius (Project Lead). Assumed dead from Vampire attack. Creator of the Aetherdeck. Was seen as the father of the Kobold pantheon.\r\n- Chief Alexandros Maxim (Security). Died from Vampire attack. Was seen as a War god in the Kobold pantheon.\r\n- Dr Tullas Kobo (Geneticist). Assumed dead from Vampire attack. Creator of the Kobolds. Was seen as the Creation god in the Kobold pantheon.\r\n- Dr Yulius Cheaser (Biologist). Assumed dead from Vampire attack. Was seen as the Healing god in the Kobold pantheon.\r\n- Dr Pores Paxis (Arcanologist). Assumed dead from Vampire attack. Creator of anti-Dragon equipment. Was seen as the Magic god in the Kobold pantheon.\r\n- Dr Verdum Kruxas (Virulogist). Turned into a Vampire, killed by the party. Creator of the DRAVID disease. Was seen as the Death god in the Kobold pantheon.\r\n- Kornus Moixa (Animal Handler). Turned into a Vampire and killed by Handeep. A controversial part of the Kobold Pantheon, as was formally a Protector goddess but is now seen as a fallen God.",s="# Mandevrath Arc\r\n\r\n## Session 1: Mandevrath\r\n\r\nThe party arrive at Mandevrath, where they encounter some Hentegrey army deserters and spiders. They quickly defeated all enemies and interrogate the survivors, learning about the Collector's interest in Mandevrath.\r\n\r\n## Session 2: Droids\r\n\r\nThe party found themselves stuck in a room that eventually turned out to be a contamination cleansing process. They also discovered a few Droids which Raorik took an interest in.\r\n\r\n## Session 3: The Collectors\r\n\r\nThe Collectors finally arrived at Mandevrath, and bargained with the party for ownership of the facility. This resulted in battle, where the party barely won. The party entered the final room, discovering a special type of spider that could phase through walls.\r\n\r\n## Session 4: Mystery at Mandevrath\r\n\r\nRaorik, Bendris and Geliah ventured deep into Mandevrath to find out secrets within. There were strange happenings within the walls of the underground where it appeared to be a laboratory. Further investigations lead the group to discover an ancient base to find a way to battle the Dragon threat. The denizens of Mandevrath developed biological warfare to stem the tide of the Dragon forces. In doing so they developed various Dragon-themed weaponry and found ways to bend space and time in secret rooms to further their reach. The group found the last door holding something within and stand ready venture forth.\r\n\r\n## Session 5: Kruxas & Handeep\r\n\r\nHaving ascertained the murky nature of the tragedy that had befallen the researchers of Mandevrath, the party proceeded into the two-keycard sealed vault (that had been hereto unopened for potentially hundreds of years). As soon as the doors opened, they were presented with what appeared to be an attempted jailbreak - Kobolds had been enslaved by Vampire Kobolds (who were overseen by the three remaining surviving researchers who had become Vampires of their own). At that moment, only one Head Vampire was present alongside a handful of VK who were attempting to restrain and even kill the escaping Kobolds. The party leapt into action, and after a very nearly deadly battle, successfully killed the Head Vampire (who was identified as Kruxas) and the VK. They then freed the caged Kobolds, as well as a curiously Undead Spectral (whose powers were manifested through sheer will of vengeance), then set about planning for an expedition into the now-uncovered Kobold caves to free the remaining Kobolds (which potentially means slaying the Vampires).\r\n\r\n## Session 6: Moixa and the Kobold City\r\n",i="# Mandevrath\r\n\r\n## Aetherdeck instructions\r\n\r\nMake sure you have enough power. Not sure what will happen to subjects inside the Aetherdeck if there is a blackout! We are not sure if the affect is an overlay on top of the room, or a transportation into a separate pocket dimension.\r\n\r\nSimple have the subjects enter the aetherdeck and lock the room behind them. The aetherdeck must be completely sealed before it can function; any gaps and the effect is lost.\r\n\r\nKey in the code into the panel and press start. The code consists of three numbers ranging from 1 - 3.\r\n\r\nThe room will operate for 30 mins until the automatic fail-safe kicks in and returns the Aetherdeck back to normal. The failsafe can be overridden, but please don't do this unless you are 100% sure what is on the other side.\r\n\r\n## Aetherdeck tests.\r\n\r\nSubjects exploring rooms. Code and results are given. Each room seems to reset on each new start.\r\n\r\n- 1-1-1: Verdant farmland, always ripe for harvest.\r\n- 1-1-2: Subjects never return.\r\n- 1-1-3: Caves rich in metal ores.\r\n- 1-1-4: Subjects never return.\r\n\r\nDue to the loss of so many subjects to the Aetherdeck, we are suspending active exploration. We are looking at utilising droids manufactured upstairs to continue exploration.",d={name:"Campaign",data:function(){return{splitterModel:20,tab:"people",tabs:[{id:"people",name:"Dramatis Personae"},{id:"session",name:"Sessions"},{id:"notes",name:"Notes"}],markdown:{people:o,sessions:s,notes:i}}}},l=d,h=t("2877"),c=t("8562"),p=t("429b"),u=t("7460"),m=t("adad"),f=t("823b"),b=t("eebe"),y=t.n(b),w=Object(h["a"])(l,n,r,!1,null,null,null);a["default"]=w.exports;y()(w,"components",{QSplitter:c["a"],QTabs:p["a"],QTab:u["a"],QTabPanels:m["a"],QTabPanel:f["a"]})}}]);
