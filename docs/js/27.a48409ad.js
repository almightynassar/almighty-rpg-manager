All three are necessary and complement each other. And so, the world is composed of three equal parts; the aether, the Mid-Realm, and the nether. The aether is the beginning of all things, and is known as the plane of creation and growth. The Mid-Realm is where everything exists, and where every story is told. And the nether is where all things must end, either remembered or forgotten, and is known as the plane of entropy and decay.\r\n\r\nEach of these realms overlap each other, as they are different aspects of the same entity. No realm could exist on it’s own, and the realms became mirrors of each other. Where a mountain is formed in one realm, it will then appear in the others.\r\n\r\nEach of the planes began to express wills and desires of their own, and these wills became the Gods of the planes. Artra ruled over the aether, Rulik held dominion over the Mid-Realm, and Baltha watched over the nether. The Gods initially agreed to keep everything in balance and that all life must have a beginning, a midwsdle, and an end. But, as with all creatures that have wills and desires, they began to scheme and plot and lust after power.\r\n\r\nAs life was beginning to arrive in Mid-Realm, starting at the World-Center, Artra stealthily created Primus on an island hidden to the south, which is now known as The Blight. Primus had direct access to all of the creative energies of the aether, and could not die. This greatly angered Baltha, and the god then began to try and suck Primus out of Mid-Realm and into the nether. But Primus resisted, and drew upon the aether directly to keep them bound to Mid-Realm. The battle between Baltha and Primus cast a sickness on the island, and all lifeforms became blighted and diseased. All except the region around Primus, kept healthy by residual energy from the aether.\r\n\r\nThe battle lasted for centuries, but eventually Baltha relented. But in their fury, the lord of the nether struck a hole in the World-Center, thinning the fabric between the Mid-Realm and the other realms. If Artra was to have Primus, then Baltha would leave his mark on the World-Center. Baltha then raised up two mountains to symbolise the duality of life and death, and as a passive-aggressive reminder to the other Gods that with every beginning there must come an end.\r\n",o="Rulik, not to be outdone by the other Gods, decides to create a people that embody Mid-Realm and it’s transient nature. Rulik fashioned the Gauld, and they emerged out of the thinning of the barrier between realms at the World-Center. They are a mortal race and, unlike Primus, they could reproduce and multiply. They are humanoid in appearance, but slightly larger than humans. Rulik gifted them with knowledge, and imbued them with the knowledge to craft tools and a desire to forge their own stories by changing the world around them to suit their needs. Baltha was appeased that the Gauld would end up in the nether when their story was done, and did not object. But Artra was offended that the Gauld could create without the aether, and secretly despised Rulik’s creation.\r\n\r\nPrimus, now free from battle with Baltha, could feel the creation of the Gauld through the aether. He left The Blight and journeyed towards the World-Center so that he could meet the Gauld. It was a positive encounter for both parties, as Primus taught the Gauld the secrets of agriculture and the Gauld showed Primus how to create without using aether. Upon the meeting spot, the Gauld fashioned the first great city of Hirst where the Gauld and Primus lived in harmony.\r\n\r\nFrom the city of Hirst, the Gauld made great leaps in science and knowledge. They furthered their knowledge in maths, science, construction and agriculture. All of these advancements allowed the Gauld to spread across the different lands. They were even able to harness the power of Primordial Shards that was harvested byPrimus on their behalf from the aether, and could imbue their tools with special properties.\r\n\r\nDuring this golden age, the Gauld were able to fashion an artificial sentient being called the Forged. They fashion bodies made of metal and stone, and crafted Primordial Shards in such a specific way that the metal bodies were able to come to life. The Forged have memories of their own, and are able to reason and create just like their builders.\r\n",s="But as the Gauld were progressing and advancing, Primus was beginning to feel Artra’s jealousy of the Gauld. Primus was limited to creating ‘miracles’ through their direct connection with the aether, and was feeling stagnant. Primus wanted to create as the Gauld did. To that end the immortal was able to gather up a devoted following who saw Primus as a God, calling themselves the Primordialists. Primus then left Hirst with his followers, travelling to a nearby land and creating a new city called Citadel.\r\n\r\nIn the Citadel, Primus experimented on the Primordialists in an attempt to create something new. They achieved this by eventually fusing primordial essence into a Gauld, creating the first Primordials. Each new primordial only had a limited connection with the aether and could only control a part of the natural world. But the Primordials also inherited mortality and reproduction from the Gauld, and could propagate their species. The Primordials soon set out from the Citadel and spread across Terrea, living among the Gauld.\r\n\r\nRulik grew wary of Primus and their Primordials, and began to worry that the Gauld would all willingly become Primordials. So Rulik decided to gift the knowledge of controlling aether energy directly to the Gauld. The aether energy that the Gauld controls manifests itselg as a Specter, and is a representation of the user's willpower and spirit. A Specter gave the user supernatural powers that are unique to the user. Rulik believed that the Specters would allow the Gauld to withstand against any force, primordial or otherwise.\r\n\r\nThe discovery of Specters led to the formalisation of its use, and academies dedicatd to teaching how to harness your Specter formed across the Terrea. However this led to tensions inside Gauld society, and conflicts arose about how to use the aether. Tensions were rapidly rising, which led to the Great War",h="Primus finally achieved creation without solely relying on the aether after the birth of the Primordial race with the help of the Primordialists. The Gauld took notes from this event and used it to drive their knowledge about creating fantastical devices powered by Primoridal shards, to the point that the Gauld essentially met or surpassed modern technology feats (they don't need electronics and computers when they have 'magic' power). So the Gauld were already on their way to achieving new heights, and Primus already felt left behind.\r\n\r\nPrimus wanted everything, and to this end he believed there was only one solution; Godhood. But they could not achieve this alone, and so Primus secretly sought help from allies among the Gauld. This was kept hidden, because there was already tensions (and sometimes outright violence) between Gauld factions. Primus headed a massive world-wide conspiracy with one goal; how to turn someone into a God.\r\n\r\nBut the conspiracy was eventually discovered, and the Gods immediately went on the offensive. But Primus was not alone this time, as their Gauld allies had created terrible and awe-inspiring machines that allowed them to hold their own against the Gods. The battles raged across the world, and it became an arms race between the two sides. Artra and Baltha created increasingly deadly monsters and devastating plagues to ravage the Gauld and PrimordialS, while the mortals invented new devices and weapons of war to keep up.\r\n\r\nOnly Rulik abstained from the fighting, horrified at what has befallen to Terrea. Rulik only decided to act near the end, when Artra and Baltha created a disease that sterilized it's host instead of killing them, allowing the invisible disease to spread and infect the whole mortal population before being detected. As a retaliation, the mortals sought to tear the realms apart in a dying bid to get even with the Gods. Rulik could stand aside no longer, and he sought an audience with Primus.\r\n\r\nRulik offered to delicately sunder the Mid-Realm into two distinct pieces, and offer ownership of one half as a sanctuary for the Primus and their allies. Mid-Realm would remain, but it will have a twin that follows in it's shadow. And, more importantly, it would be kept away from the clutches of Artra and Baltha. Primus reluctantly agreed; it was not complete Godhood, but it was an existence. The other Gods were infuriated at first when they learned of Rulik's deal, but relented when they learned that the Sundering would strip some of the potency in primoridal magics to create the new realm, ensuring that mortals would never again achieve the feats of the Gauld.\r\n\r\nWhen the Sundering was complete, the Primus traded his connection to the aether for direct control of the new Shadowrealm. He named it Sanctuary, and his allies began to pass into Sanctuary. The passage left behind more than just their bodies, and they became the Spirits, Daemons and Shadows of the Shadowrealm. They remember only a part of what they used to be, and no longer concerned themselves about matters of the flesh. All except the Primus, who since their birth was spited by the Gods. He secretly kept a private oath that they would all return, and that Primus would take the Godhood that they believe was rightly theirs.\r\n\r\nSome of the Gauld stayed behind, even though they were sterilized and doomed as a race. They were mainly the Specters, who saw the Gauld who followed Primus as foolish and wanted to pass into the nether as normal. These Gauld worked tirelessly to ensure that a part of Gauld culture survived in Terrea, and to maybe pass on the secrets of Specters to a worthy heir.\r\n",d="The victory celebration of the Gods was brief as the Gauldish population dwindled in the Mid-Realm, and Terrea fell silent. Their hearts ached for what they had lost, as the Gauld and Primordials were still their children. With a heavy heart the Gods watched the remaining Gauld and Forged retreat into the crumbling citadels of Phalanxis, Trellisanthe, and Al-Khaleera.\r\n\r\nIn their quest for redemption and self-forgiveness, the Gods fashioned the human race in the image of the Gauld. The humans were shorter, less intelligent and less capable than the Gauld, but they retained a sense of Gauldish inquisitiveness. The first humans emerged out of the World-Center into Mid-Realm, and journeyed out and inhabited the citadel of Hirst.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile in Phalanxis, Sesom the Wanderer rose up to become the leader of the remaining Gauld and Forged. He sought to preserve all of the knowledge of the Gauld by increasing the memory capacity and processing speed of the Forged, thereby creating the Elderforged. Sesom ultimately wanted to bring about the return of the Gauld to Mid-Realm, by either reversing the sterility of his peoples or by un-sundering the realms. Sesom passed before he could realise his vision, but there are rumours that Sesom found the secret to immortality and continues his work deep underground and that the Elderforged are the key to his plans.\r\n\r\nThe remaining Gauld Specters sought refuge in the jungle citadel of Trellisanthe, where they created the secret order of The Collectors. The organisation quickly and covertly sought out powerful Spectre users among the emerging human race and inducted them into their ranks, ensuring that their secrets would continue to live on. They continue on to this day, securing any spectral artifacts to safeguard it.\r\n\r\nThe humans began to spread across all of Mid-Realm as the Gauld and Primordials died out, and the Gods were beginning to get bored again. They were dissatisfied with the progress made by the humans compared to their Gaulish ancestors, and they each set to work to try to “remedy” this so-called problem in their own way. Rulik sought to create races that filled a role, and gave life to the Snvert, Dwarves and Teztec. Artra created his new races in a more “personal” manner and created the Lefantians, Lacerti, Avians, Mermen, and Minotaurs. Baltha, always ruled by order and death, created the Goblins, Orcs, and Locanth.\r\n\r\nAs the age came to a close, the sentient races began to create their own unique cultural identity. The humans united under the first King, Perlio Hentergrey, centered around the ancient Gauldish capital of Hirst. The Teztec inhabited the Tezonian Jungles and mastered the primordial essence found in all natural things. The Mermen utilised their mastery of the oceans to become sea-faring traders, while competing with the industrial might of the Dwarves. The Snvert repurposed ancient Gauldian technology to power their cities, while the Orcs and Goblins plunder and raid their neighbours. The minotaurs were able to grow crops in the far north, and the Avians were able to inhabit the deserts of Azia. As the young races matured and the natural land tamed, tension began to rise...\r\n",l="The Written Age was coined by the burgeoning Academy, a decentralized collective of academics and sages that actively pursued and categorised knowledge. They began to write the histories of Terrea, and began formal study of ancient Gauldish technology to see if they could recreate it. Official branches of the Academy can be found in almost all cities of Terrea, but their main headquarters can be found in Hirst.\r\n\r\nThe city of Hirst also experienced a massive political change, as King Perlio was nearing the end of his life and he had no heir. His lifespan was already unnaturally long, and there were many rumours that the King had help from supernatural forces. The Kingdom of Hentergrey became increasingly militarized and expansionist, and the King sent out his forces in search of artifacts that were connected to the Shadowrealm. People braced themselves for something dark and foreboding, not knowing what exactly was coming next.\r\n\r\nThen, one day the King declared that he had an heir all along and that the heir would be revealed on his deathbed. And so, in a locked room with no witnesses, the King passed away that was marked by the white smoke that escaped from the chimney in his room. When the doors opened, a regal youth emerged that claimed he was the heir and that he had cremated his dying father. And so has the crown passed on along the Hentergrey dynasty; the heir hidden from his realm, only to emerge after the king has died. This has never stopped the rumours that the Hentergrey dynasty have deep ties with the Shadowrealm, a rumour that the ruling class has taken great pains to silence.\r\n\r\nTo the far north, on the continent of Naati, the Lacertan and Human colonists were finally able to realise their eugenic goal; the perfect genetic combination. The resulting offspring were called the Lacerta Hominum (or, more commonly, Lacinum). From this, their entire culture revolved around this genetic ideal, and each individual was separated into different castes. The highest social caste was reserved for the Lacinum that best represented the 50-50 genetic split between humans and lacerti, while the lowest caste were for stock standard examples of the respective species. Individuals with more Lacertan blood were generally kept as defenders of the nation, while those individuals that were more human were generally sent out abroad as operatives. It was on this basis that the nation of Illumi Naati was founded, ruled over by their Lacinum overlords.\r\n\r\nThe College of Speechcraft was also founded as a place for talented individuals in Illumi Naati to learn the art of rhetoric and persuasion. The College became a cabal of silver-tongued diplomats that have slowly inserted themselves into various positions of authority across the world. The College in particular highly values the Avians for their mimicry ability, using them as recording devices. Because of their political power, the College protect their diplomats using a highly trained force skilled in both martial and magic warfare to act as elite bodyguards and protect the interests of Illumi Naati.\r\n\r\nOne of the most notable achievements of the College was the banding of the disparate Dwarven clans into one united Federation. This Federation formalised the debt trade, which is the preferred term the Dwarves use for slavery, and allowed the Dwarves to sell their manufactured wares abroad. This achievement brought them into a pact with the Collectors, where the College would sell information about spectral artifacts while offering their powerful spectral users as bodyguards.\r\n\r\nA massive explosion in Phalanxis released a load of primordial essence into the world, and caused damage to the ancient city. The neighbouring nation of Lefantia aided the Forged refugees, and many flocked to the ruins to try to repair (or loot) the city. These peoples are collectively known as Gearshifters, and they became the source of rumours that the explosion was caused by one of the ancient experiments left behind by Sesom that was aiming to open a direct portal to the Shadowrealm. Another interested faction, the Collectors, quickly swooped in and tried to save as many spectral artifacts they could, one of them being a unique Elderforged that had a spectre. The Elderforged was named Spectrum, and became a being of reverence among the Collectors.\r\n\r\nIn the ice-covered continent of Snvert, the Snvert delve deep into the ruins of Berelynn and cart any Gauldish technology they can find to the city of Snvert. Their whole city and economy is powered by converted technology, to the point that the Snvert Council foresaw that running out of new technology would devastate the Snvert. The council decided to create the Snvert New Viable Essence Retrieval Team (or S.N.V.E.R.T.), an expeditionary task force that is charged with travelling Terrea and bringing back new technologies to keep the economy running.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately for the Snvert, disaster struck early. A large force of Orcs and Goblins began to raid their shores, and devastated the many villages and towns that dotted the coast. The Snvert tried to repel the raiders in a battle known as Snvertfall, but the brute strength and cunning of the green and grey skins proved too much for Snvert technology. The Snvert retreated into their towns and cities, and villages moved underground or into defensible caverns. The raids and the dwindling reserves of essence have meant that the Snvert have become increasingly desperate.\r\n\r\nThe Orcs and Goblins also sent a raiding force against the Mermen of Myrmiddon, and were able to disrupt the trading lanes. The Mermen were able to keep the Orcs from landing their raiding forces, but the Orcish fleets were still able to terrorise and pirate the merchant fleets. They also engage in pirate activity on the eastern shores of Hentergrey, but stay far away from the Citadel where the Dragons hold sway.\r\n\r\nThe Mermen, being the premier traders of Terrea, introduced a form of currency that is used by all the nations. They create trade deals with all of the nations, and compete with the Dwarves in selling high-quality wares. In particular, the Mermen were able to secure exclusive access to Minotaur pharmaceutical products.\r\n\r\nAt the close of the age, King Perlio (as every king of Hentergrey adopts the name of their ancestor upon ascension to the throne) began to have grander designs. They raised a large military force that invaded the neighbouring countries of Teztec, Lefantia, and Azia. These invasions formed the Hentergrey Empire, and the emperor began to impose a sort of martial law across Hentergrey. The military forced the citizens to use essence in their everyday lives, and the Academy was driven to research ways to access the Shadowrealm. The Emperor had an obsession with Primus, and the citizens began to informally refer to the monarch as the Dark Emperor.\r\n\r\nThat closes the Written Age, and you are at the beginning of a new age.
